Cross-platform locks for threads and processes.

ðŸ”© Install
----------

```
pip install fasteners
```

ðŸ”© Usage
--------
Lock for processes has the same API as the 
[threading.Lock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Lock)
for threads:
```python
import fasteners
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()                                 # for threads
lock = fasteners.InterProcessLock('path/to/lock.file')  # for processes

with lock:
    ... # exclusive access

# or alternatively    

lock.acquire()
... # exclusive access
lock.release()
```

Reader Writer lock has a similar API, which is the same for threads or processes:

```python
import fasteners

rw_lock = fasteners.ReaderWriterLock()                                 # for threads
rw_lock = fasteners.InterProcessReaderWriterLock('path/to/lock.file')  # for processes

with rw_lock.write_lock():
    ... # write access

with rw_lock.read_lock():
    ... # read access

# or alternatively

rw_lock.acquire_read_lock()
... # read access
rw_lock.release_read_lock()

rw_lock.acquire_write_lock()
... # write access
rw_lock.release_write_lock()
```

ðŸ”© Overview
-----------

Python standard library provides a lock for threads (both a reentrant one, and a
non-reentrant one, see below). Fasteners extends this, and provides a lock for
processes, as well as Reader Writer locks for both threads and processes.
Definitions of terms used in this overview can be found in the
[glossary](https://fasteners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/glossary/).

The specifics of the locks are as follows:

### Process locks

The `fasteners.InterProcessLock` uses [fcntl](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html) on Unix-like systems and 
msvc [_locking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/locking?view=msvc-160) on Windows. 
As a result, if used cross-platform it guarantees an intersection of their features:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| fcntl                        | âœ˜ | âœ˜ |
| _locking                     | âœ” | âœ” |
| fasteners.InterProcessLock   | âœ˜ | âœ˜ |


The `fasteners.InterProcessReaderWriterLock` also uses fcntl on Unix-like systems and 
[LockFileEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-lockfileex) on Windows. Their 
features are as follows:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory | upgradable | preference | 
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| fcntl                                    | âœ˜ | âœ˜ | âœ” | reader |
| LockFileEx                               | âœ” | âœ” | âœ˜ | reader |
| fasteners.InterProcessReaderWriterLock   | âœ˜ | âœ˜ | âœ˜ | reader |


### Thread locks

Fasteners does not provide a simple thread lock, but for the sake of comparison note that the `threading` module
provides both a reentrant and non-reentrant locks:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| threading.Lock  | âœ˜ | âœ˜ |
| threading.RLock | âœ” | âœ˜ |


The `fasteners.ReaderWriterLock` at the moment is as follows:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory | upgradable | preference | 
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| fasteners.ReaderWriterLock | âœ” | âœ˜ | âœ˜ | writer |

If your threads are created by some other means than the standard library `threading`
module (for example `eventlet`), you may need to provide the corresponding thread
identification and synchronisation functions to the `ReaderWriterLock`.
