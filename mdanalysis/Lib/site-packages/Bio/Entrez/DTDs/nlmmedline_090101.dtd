<!-- NLMMedline DTD              

     Comments and suggestions are welcome.
     January 1, 2009 v.3

     **THIS IS THE FORTHCOMING DTD FOR 2009 NOT CURRENTLY IN USE.  
     SEE http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/nlmmedline_080101.dtd FOR THE 
     NLMMEDLINE DTD DATED JANUARY 1, 2008 CURRENTLY IN USE.**  
            
     This is the DTD which the U.S. National Library of Medicine 
     has written for External Use.        
     If you are a data Licensee, the data are found in 
     MedlineCitationSet.       
 
     NOTE:  The use of "Medline" in a DTD or element name does not mean the record 
     represents a citation from a Medline-selected journal.  When the NLM DTDs and 
     XML elements were first created, MEDLINE records were the only data exported. 
     Now NLM exports citations other than MEDLINE records using these tools. To 
     minimize unnecessary disruption to users of the data and tools, NLM has
     retained the original DTD and element names (e.g., NLMMedline DTD, MedlineTA,
     MedlineJournalInfo)).       
       
  * = 0 or more occurrences (optional element, repeatable)
  ? = 0 or 1 occurrences (optional element, at most 1)
  + = 1 or more occurrences (required element, repeatable)
  | = choice, one or the other but not both 
  no symbol = required element
