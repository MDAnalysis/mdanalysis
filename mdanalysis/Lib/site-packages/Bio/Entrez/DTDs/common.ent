<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

     
 29. NEW ELEMENT <x> GENERATED TEXT AND PUNCTUATION
     Added a container element to hold punctuation or other 
     generated text, typically when 1) an archive decides not 
     to have any text generated and thus to pre-generate such 
     things as commas or semicolons between keywords or 2) 
     when an archive receives text with <x> tags embedded and 
     wishes to retain them.

 28. PUBLISHER - Moved element here from %journalmeta.ent;
     module since Book DTD also needed it and was not including
     that module.

 27. PAGE ELEMENT ATTRIBUTES
     a. Made an Parameter Entity for:
        - %fpage-atts;
        - %elocation-id-atts;
     b. Gave %elocation-id-atts" the attribute "seq"
        
 26. PUB ID TYPES - Added the new attribute values to the
     Parameter Entity %pub-id-types;, which is used on <article>
     and other elements. New values: pmcid and art-access-id

 25. CUSTOM METADATA - Added the new <custom-meta> element, its
     components, and its wrapper. This element is used to insert
     name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
     material but were never envisioned by this DTD. Allowed this
     element at the end of <article-meta>.

 24. DATES 
     a. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
        hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
        inside a <string-date>
     b. Also used %date-parts.class; and %x.class; in 
        the new PE %string-date-elements;

 23. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
     #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
     contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
     designed to prohibit element content and permit only
     #PCDATA or mixed content.) Added parentheses to Parameter
     Entity and removed them from the Element Declaration.
     - %custom-meta-model;
     - %custom-meta-wrap-model;
     - %def-model;
     - %sec-model;
     - %sec-opt-title-model;
     - Removed parentheses from <notes>, <ack>, <address>, <date>

 22. CITATION MODEL / COPYRIGHT STATEMENT MODEL
     ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Replaced the Parameter Entity %copyright-statement-model; 
        with the OR list Parameter Entity 
        %copyright-statement-elements; and used that
        within the content model of <copyright-statement>
     b. Citation - In the PE %citation-elements; also
        changed the PE -%ext-links.class; ==> -%address-links.class;
        (Changed the content model of citation to match.)
     c. In -%copyright-statement-elements;, replaced the mix 
        -%rendition-plus; with its  constituent classes
     d. In -%citation-elements;, replaced the mix -%simple-text;
        with its constituent classes (with exception of 
        %address-link.class;).

 21. RELATED ARTICLE
     ### Customization Alert ###
      - Renamed 
         -%related-article-model; ==> -%related-article-elements;
          (To match the DTD naming convention that full content 
          models are named with a "-model" suffix and groups of 
          elements to be added to #PCDATA for a particular
          content model are named "-elements".)
      - Started "-related-article-elements" PE with an OR Bar
      - Deleted "ext-links.class", because these elements are 
        already in the %references.class; (no model change)

 20. INLINE MATH - <inline-formula> added to:
     - %label-elements; 

 19. RELATED ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - Added the following attributes
     to the element <related-article>:
     a.  "id" - to provide a unique identifier
     b.  "alternate-form-of", which works (similarly to the same 
         attribute when used on a <graphic> element) to point to 
         another <related-article> element within the same document 
         as an alternate form of the related article.

 18. ISSUE TITLE <issue-title> - Created new element for a theme or
     special issue title
        - Defined here in the common module
        - Added to <article-meta>
        - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
          <product>, and <related-article>
        - Created new Parameter Entities %issue-title-elements; 
          which hold the OR-group of elements that may be mixed with 
          #PCDATA inside the content model 

 17. ATTRIBUTION
      - Moved <attrib> and its Parameter Entities from the paragraph
        module to here, as it is numerous elements, such as <array>, 
        <boxed-text>, <fig>, <table-wrap>, etc., in the Archival DTD.

 16. CUSTOM METADATA - Added the new <custom-meta> element, its
     components, and its wrapper. This element is used to insert
     name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
     material but were never envisioned by this DTD. Allowed this
     element at the end of <article-meta> and <journal-meta>.

 15. EMAIL- Considered to be just another type of external link, as
     <ext-link> is, so added to:
     - %collab-elements;
     - %copyright-statement-elements;

 14. DATES 
     a. Added new class %date-parts.class; to hold all the
        potential components of date, such as <year>, <day>,
        etc.
     b. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
        hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
        inside a <string-date>
     c. Used %date-parts.class; in that model.

 13. ROLE ELEMENT - Was added to the model for <citation>, thus
     moved to this module from the article metadata module.


 12. NEW IDENTIFICATION ELEMENTS - in view of the larger role that 
     some publishers are giving to DOIs:

     a. OBJECT ID  -  Added a new class Parameter Entity 
        %id.class; to hold the new element <object-id> Object 
        Identifier. The <object-id> element is used to capture any 
        publisher's or archive's ID, such as a DOI. This was modeled 
        as an element (rather than as an attribute) to allow for 
        multiple  IDs. New PE used in:
          - %references.class (therefore inside <citation>, 
             <related-article>, and <product>)
          - metadata objects such as <abstract>
          - display objects such as <figure>.
        Added PE %object-id-atts; to hold the element's attributes
        
     b. ISSUE ID <issue-id> - new element for an identifier such 
        as a DOI associated with a journal issue (as opposed to the 
        existing element <issue>, which is defined as the issue 
        number) 
        - Defined here in the common module
        - Added to <article-meta>
        - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
          <product>, and <related-article>
        - Created PE %issue-id-atts; to hold the attributes.

     c. VOLUME ID <volume-id> - new element for an identifier such 
        as a DOI associated with a volume of a journal (as opposed 
        to the  existing element <volume>, which is defined as the 
        volume number) 
        - Defined here in the common module
        - Added to <article-meta>
        - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
          <product>, and <related-article>
        - Created new Parameter Entities %volume-id-elements; 
          which hold the OR-group of elements that may be mixed with 
          #PCDATA inside the content model 
        - Added PE %volume-id-atts; to hold the attributes.

     
     Note: All ID attributes for these new identification
     elements was set to use the "pub-id-type" attribute, 
     which is for Archival (Green) set as a CDATA attribute.

 11. NAME CLASS / STRING NAME / PERSON NAME CLASS
     a. Created a new element <string-name> for names that
        do not follow the former, strict personal name model.
        <string-name> holds any combination of #PCDATA and any of 
        the known personal-name elements such as <surname>.
        - Used a new Parameter Entity %string-name-elements;
          in the content model
     
     b. Created a new class %name.class; to hold all the ways
        to name people: <name>, <string-name>, and <collab>
        who produce products or articles.

     c. Allowed <string-name> to be used anywhere <name> is
        used. Inside
         - citation (by adding to %references.class;)
         - product  (by adding to %references.class;)

     d. Added new attribute "initials" to the personal name
        components: <surname> and <given-names>. This provides
        a way to preserve the initials, for matching services
        that prefer initials to full names. Since there are
        many cases in which the initials cannot be determined
        programmatically, we merely provide a bucket to record
        them.
        
     e. Added new Parameter Entities %given-name-atts; and
        %surname-atts; to hold the new "initials" attribute.

 10. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS - The Green (Archival) DTD needed to
     change all explicit attribute value lists in the DTD to CDATA. 
     In the future, explicit list types will be a feature of the
     Blue (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs. Therefore, added
     Parameter entities to hold the following attributes:
       - date-type

  9. RELATED ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - Added the following attributes
     to the element <related-article>:
      - "id ID #IMPLIED" attribute, so the related-article
        can be referenced.
      - "ext-link-type" - to indicate the type of link used to 
        point to the related article. Attribute was used with 
        exactly the same content (CDATA) and suggested values 
        as when used with the element <ext-link>.
      - "issue" - used (along with "vol", "page", and "journal-id")
         to provide metadata concerning the related article
      - "journal-id"- used (along with "vol", "page", and "issue")
         to provide metadata concerning the related article.
      - "journal-id-type" - Performs the same function that this
        attribute performs for the element <journal-id>. The
        "journal-id"  values are the same as those for existing 
        journal identifiers plus "issn".
      - "alternate-form-of", which works (similarly to the same 
        attribute when used on a <graphic> element) to point to 
        another <related-article> element within the same document 
        as an alternate form of the related article.
     
  8. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. RENAME ELEMENT MIXES NOT TO END IN "-elements", since that
        suffix is reserved for mixes that are added to #PCDATA in
        a particular element
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Names ending in "-elements" saved for element-specific mixes
        that will be added to #PCDATA for one element
        -  %sec-back-matter-elements; ==> %sec-back-matter-mix;
               (Used in -%sec-model; and -%sec-opt-title-model;)
     
     b. NEW CLASSES - Largely for classing and modification reasons,
        the following new classes were added:
        - %date.class;
        - %def.class;
        - %degree.class;
        - %id.class; 
        - Removed duplicate %person-name.class;

     c. NEW MIXES - To correct potential classing problems, new 
        Parameter Entities were created. The following content 
        models were changed to use these new entities.
        - <etal>           -%etal-elements;
        - <ext-link>       -%ext-link-elements;
        - <fax>            -%fax-elements;
        - <given-names>    -%given-names-elements;
        - <issn>           -%issn-elements;
        - <issue>          -%issue-elements;
        - <label>          -%label-elements;
        - <long-desc>      -%long-desc-elements;
        - <phone>          -%phone-elements;
        - <prefix>         -%prefix-elements;
        - <publisher-name> -%publisher-name-elements;
        - <role>           -%role-elements;
        - <suffix>         -%suffix-elements;
        - <surname>        -%surname-elements;
        - <uri>            -%uri-elements;
        - <volume>         -%volume-elements;
        - <volume-id>      -%volume-id-elements;

        - <bio>      %bio-model; (which uses %just-para.class;)
        - <def>      %def-model;
        - <def>      %just-para.class;
 
     d. RENAME CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        following to add the class suffix:
        - %address-elements; (renamed -%address.class;) used in 
            - %aff-elements; 
            - %publisher-loc-elements;
            - %address-model;
        - %inline-math.class; used in -%label-elements; 
 
     e. PE %attrib-elements;
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Uses %emphasized-text; which now starts with an OR bar, so
        removed the OR bar from this PE.

     f. LINK CLASSES
        - In %aff-elements;, replaced %link.class; with
          the following classes (via use of %all-phrase;)
          (no DTD change):
            - %address-link.class;  (external used in addresses)
            - %simple-link.class;   (the internal links, same)
            - %article-link.class;  (for journal articles)
       -  In -%collab-elements;
            - Replaced -%ext-links.class; with the following class
              (via use of %all-phrase;)
              (no DTD change):
              - address-link.class; (external used in addresses)
            - Deleted -%inpara-address; 
              (No model change, %address-link.class; covers it.)
       -  In %copyright-statement-elements;, replaced 
          -%inpara-address; with -%address-link.class;
          (via use of %all-phrase;)

  7. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;

  6. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" 
     
     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  5. Made <copyright-statement> model into a parameter entity in 
     order to add <ext-link> to the content model.
     Rationale:  Permit linkage between copyright statement and 
     copyright holder's site.

  4. Added attribute "content-type" to element <ack>. 
     Rationale: To identify and preserve the semantic intent of 
     semantically rich source documents.
               
  3. Added ID attribute to the following elements:
       - <ack> 
       - <address> 
       - <alt-text>
       - <ext-link> (by modifying %ext-link-atts;)
       - <institution>
       - <long-desc> 
       - <notes> (by modifying parameter entity %notes-atts;)
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so these elements can be 
     linked to.  
     
  2. Added element <label> to content model of <aff> (by adding
     -%label.class; to parameter -%aff-elements;)
     Rationale: To provide <label>  when needed for format 
     over-ride.
     
     =============================================================
     Version 1.0 Changes Before Public Release
                                       (Lapeyre) v1.0 (2002-12-25)

  1. ETAL - Changed the content model of <etal> to replace the
     entire content model with a Parameter Entity, not just name 
     some elements that may mix with #PCDATA. Rationale: The 
     Authoring DTD would like to make <etal> EMPTY.         
                                                                   -->

                        first day and last day of the conference.

                        Remarks: Information on the role or type of
                        contribution is collected in two places,
                        in the "contrib-type" attribute on the
                        Contributor element and in the Role element.  
                        For example, the Contributor attribute might 
                        have a value of "editor", while the content 
                        of the role element could be "Associate 
                        Editor". As another example, the contributor
                        attribute might be "author" and the role
                        element might be "Principle Author".
                        The <role> element is also more likely to 
                        appear on screen or in print than the 
                        contributor attribute value.               -->

                        does not have traditional page numbers. 
                        For a printed article, when citations are 
                        sent through the Medline matcher to be turned
                        into live links or when the metadata about an
                        article is collected for complete
                        identification,  the first page number (and 
                        sometimes  also the last page number) of the 
                        article is recorded to help indicate which
                        article is being referenced. Electronic only
                        journals have no page numbers, so this
                        element is used as the equivalent identifier,
                        the "electronic page number" that helps to
                        identify the article. The value could be an 
                        article identifier, a doi, etc., for 
                        example, "E70".

                        electronic identifier, and it was considered
                        renaming this element to that. The purpose
                        of the name is to be a parallel with the
                        <fpage>...<lpage> model. When neither first
                        page or last page is appropriate, because
                        the electronic journal has no pages, the
                        <elocation-id> element is used instead.    -->

<!--                    A citation is a description of a work, such
                        as a journal article, book, or personal
                        communication, that is cited in the text of
                        the article. Although the DTD does not
                        enforce it, a citation to a journal article
                        *should* be tagged with as many as possible 
                        of the following, so that PubMed Central or
                        other matching processing can make the 
                        citation into a live link:

                        Authoring and Conversion Note: In order to 
                        make citations into live links, as much
                        of the author and date information as is
                        available should be preserved. The most
                        important date tag is year, and it should
                        always be tagged if possible:
                            <year>2003</year> 
                        The <day> and <month> tags will be used
                        more rarely; they are provided because some
                        of the citation matching services can use
