<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 19. OTHER-TABLE-WRAP-ATTS - Moved this Parameter Entity from
     the Archiving (Green) customization module to this module,
     so that all variant DTDs could use it. Possible for both 
     <table-wrapper> and <table-group>.

 18. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
     #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
     contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
     designed to prohibit element content and permit only
     #PCDATA or mixed content.) Added parentheses to Parameter
     Entity and removed them from the Element Declaration.
     -  %array-model; 
     -  %boxed-text-model; 
     -  %chem-struct-wrapper-model; 
     -  %fig-model; 
     -  %fig-group-model; 
     -  %preformat-model; 
     -  %table-wrap-model; 
     -  %table-wrap-group-model; 
     -  %table-wrap-foot-model; 

 17. LOOSENING FIGURE - %label.class; and %caption.class; both 
     allowed to repeat in <fig> model, to allow for alternate
     placements.
     
 16. OBJECT ID/DOI - added to elements by request of AIT WG. 
     Elements with DOIs are those a publisher could expect to sell 
     or handle separately. DOI is placed in an <object-id> element, 
     part of the %id.class; and added to:
      - <boxed-text>             (through %boxed-text-model;)
      - <chem-struct-wrapper>    (through %chem-struct-wrapper-model;)
      - <fig>                    (through %fig-model;)
      - <graphic>                (through %graphic-model;)
      - <media>                  (through %graphic-model;)
      - <pre-format>             (through %preformat-elements;)
      - <supplementary-material> (through %fig-model;)
      - <table-wrap>             (through %table-wrap-model;) 

     A "pub-id-type" attribute identifies the type of ID, DOI,
     archive-issued ID, etc.

      
 15. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        names to add the class suffix:
        - %display-back-matter.class; used in 
             -%array-model;      -%boxed-text-model;
             -%fig-model;        -%chem-struct-wrapper-model;
             -%graphic-model;    -%preformat-model;  
             -%table-wrap-model; -%table-wrap-foot-model; 
        - %block-math.class; (used in -%fig-model;)

     b. INLINE MIXES USE OR BARs
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Changed the following PEs to start with an OR bar:
        - %preformat-elements;

     c. NEW CLASSES - To correct potential classing problems, new 
        Parameter Entities were created:
              New Content Models PEs
        - %preformat-model;
              New Classes PEs
        - %caption.class; used in:
            - %fig-model;        - %fig-group-model;
            - %table-wrap-model; - %chem-struct-wrapper-model;
            - %graphic-model;
        - %fig-display.class; used in:
            -%fig-group-model;
        - %just-para.class; used in:
            - <caption>
            - %table-wrap-foot-model;
        - %just-table.class; used in: 
            - %table-wrap-group-model;
            - %fig-model;
        - %just-base-display.class; used in:
            - %array-model;      - %fig-group-model;
            - %chem-struct-wrapper-model;(where using it added
              the <preformat> element to <chem-struct-wrapper>
        - %tbody.class; used in
            - %array-model;
        - %chem-struct-elements; used in:
            - %chem-struct-model;

     d. ACCESS CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
        - Took <ext-link> out of -%access.class;. It did not belong.
            It belongs in -%address-link.class;
        - Added -%address-link.class; to anywhere regular
            %access.class; was used.

 14. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;

 13. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                       (TRG/BTU) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

 12. Added "mimetype" and "mime-subtype" attributes to all graphic 
     and multi-media elements, including: 
       - <graphic>
       - <inline-graphic>
       - <media>
       - <supplementary-material>

 11. Created parameter entity %media-atts; to hold attribute list
     for <media> (and replace %graphic-atts; as attribute list
     holder)
     Rationale: Needed to split attribute list for <media> from 
     that for <graphic>, in order to have different values for 
     new attribute "mimetype".

 10. Added attribute "alternate-form-of" to the following elements:
       - <array>
       - <chem-struct> (by modifying parameter entity 
         %chem-structs-atts;)
       - <graphic> (by modifying parameter entity %graphic-atts;)
       - <media> (by modifying parameter entity %graphic-atts;)
       - <supplementary-material> (by modifying parameter entity 
             %supplementary-material-atts;)
       - <inline-graphic> (by modifying parameter entity 
             %inline-graphic-atts;)
       - <preformat>
     Rationale: Where multiple formats of an item (e.g., graphic 
     file, media object, chemical structure) are available, this 
     attribute indicates that a format is a secondary one and 
     provides a link to the primary format, so that only one 
     format of an item is displayed.

  9. Modified parameter entity %array-model; so that the elements
     <graphic> and <media> could be used multiple times.
     Rationale: A series of <graphic> (or <media>) elements 
     may occur in the same content, especially if they are
     variants of one graphic (or media object) may be linked, 
     with only one variation being displayed.

  8. Added attribute "id" to the following: 
       - <inline-graphic> (via parameter entity %inline-graphic-atts;) 
       - <chem-struct> (via parameter entity %chem-struct-atts;)      
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so these elements can be 
     linked to. Some will have alternate versions which will point
     to them, others may be the target internal cross-references. 

  7. Created parameter entity %inline-graphic-atts; to hold 
     various attributes associated with <inline-graphic>
     Rationale: In order to distinguish between attribute lists
     used by the Archiving DTD and the Publishing DTD, it was 
     necessary to create a parameter entity that could be overridden.

  6. Added attribute "content-type" to the following:
       - <array>  
       - <boxed-text> by modifying parameter entity %boxed-text-atts;
       - <fig-group> by modifying parameter entity %fig-group-atts;      
       - <table-wrap> by modifying parameter entity %table-wrap-atts;
       - <supplementary-material> by modifying parameter entity 
             %supplementary-material-atts;
       - <chem-struct> by modifying parameter entity %chem-struct-atts;
       - <chem-struct-wrapper> by modifying parameter entity 
             %chem-struct-wrapper-atts;
     Rationale: To identify and preserve the semantic intent of 
     semantically rich source documents.

  5. Added ID attribute to element <array>.
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so <array> can be linked to. 

  4. Added parameter entity %label.class; to parameter entity 
     %chem-struct-model; 
     Rationale: To allow label as a format override on <chem-struct>. 

  3. Added element <label> to the parameter entity %array-model;
     Rationale: To allow label as a format override
     
  2. Added element <media> to the following parameter entities:
       - %block-display.class;
       - %simple-display.class;
       - %array-model; 
       - %chem-struct-wrapper-model;
       - %fig-group-model;                     
     Rationale: Media object <media> to occur everywhere element 
     <graphic> is allowed to occur.

  1. Added element <media> for media objects; <media> will be used 
     in the same way <graphic> is and will have the same content, 
     but be used for animation or movies.
     Rationale: To distinguish alternate media (such as movies or 
     animation) from traditional print graphic forms.
                                                                   -->

                        elements such as <caption> should always be
                        used at the highest possible level, in
                        other words, if a media object is inside a

                        should be part of the Figure, not part of
                        the media object. Elements such as <caption>
                        are used when a standalone media object 
                        requires them or when multiple media objects 
                        within a container element such as a Figure 
                        need them individually. Similarly, the

                        a <media> that is inside a larger display

                        and may take a caption.
                          In addition, the supplementary material
                        may identify its file type with the
                        "mimetype" attribute.
                        Authoring Note: Supplementary material may

                        inside a table.  This DTD uses <fn> inside 
                        tables as well as everywhere. They are
                        differentiated by context. Footnotes inside
                        a Table Wrapper are assumed to be footnotes
