<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 13. CONTRACT NAME/CONTRACT SPONSOR ATTRIBUTES - Added new attributes
     to both these elements through a new PE %contract-atts;:
      - id  (ID)
      - rid (IDREFS)
      - %might-link-atts;

 12. ROLE ELEMENT
     a. Added to the model for <citation>
     b. Therefore the element declaration for <role> was
        moved from this module into the common module.

 11. DEFAULT ARTICLE-META-MODEL - Added the following 
     elements to -%article-meta-model;:
     Existing elements:
        - <email>
     New elements:
       - <license> (for now, just a bucket into which to
         dump license-related material until the AIT Workgroup
         does more analysis
       - <issue-id> (existing <issue> means issue number)
       - <issue-title> (for special title or theme)
       - <page-range>
       - <volume-id> (existing <volume> means volume number)
       - <custom-meta-wrap> Which is a wrapper element used to hold
         name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
         material but were never envisioned by this DTD.

 10. CONTRIBUTOR / CONTRIBUTOR GROUP
     a. Made model into Parameter Entity %contrib-model;
     b. Allowed <string-name> as an alternative to <name>
     c. Allowed <degrees> to follow either <name> or 
        <string-name>
     d. Moved <etal> to %contrib-info.class; to solve \
        classing problems
     e. Added footnote <fn> to %contrib-info.class;

  9. STRING NAME
     a. Created a new element <string-name> for names that
        do not follow the former, strict personal name model.

     b. Allowed <string-name> to be used anywhere <name> is
        used. Inside
         - <product> (by adding to %references.class; used in 
           %product-elements;)
         - <contrib> (by adding to %name.class; used in 
           %contrib-model;)

  8. DOI - added to elements by request of AIT WG. Elements with
     DOIs are those a publisher could expect to sell or handle
     separately. DOI added to: (using <object-id> element)
      - <abstract> (through %abstract-model;)

  7. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Added internal parenthesis to Parameter Entity and removed 
     them from Element Declaration for:
     - %abstract-model;
     - %article-meta-model;
     - %author-notes-model;
     - %contrib-group-model;
     - %contrib-model;
     - %counts-model;
     - %date-model;
     - %title-group-model;
     - %trans-abstract-model;
 
  6. RENAMED CONTENT MODEL PARAMETER ENTITY
     ### Customization Alert ###
     - %author-notes-elements; ==> -%author-notes-model;

  5. PARAMETER ENTITIES FOR CLASSES/MIXES/ATT LISTS
     a. RENAMED CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
         Not all class names ended in the ".class" suffix. 
         Changed the following to add that suffix:
         - %address-elements; (renamed -%address.class;!)
               used in -%corresp-elements; 
         - %contrib-info.class; used in -%contrib-group-model; 
               and in -%contrib-model;
         - %inline-math.class; used in -%subject-elements;
               and in -%kwd-elements; (via %all-phrase;)

     b. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
        the module -%default-classes.ent;

     c. NEW PARAMETER ENTITIES - To correct potential classing 
        problems,  new Parameter Entities were created. The following
        PEs and models were changed to use these new PEs:
             New Content model PEs:
        - %date.class;        in %history-elements; 
        - %kwd.class;         in %kwd-group-model;
        - %just-para.class;   in <author-comment>
        
        - %author-comments;   in <author-comments>
        - %contrib-model;     in <contrib>
        - %history-model;     in <history>      
        - %kwd-group-model;   in <kwd-group>
        
        - In <author-notes> "(corresp | fn)+" was replaced
          with the %fn-link.class; and the new class
          -%corresp.class;)

              New Attribute List PEs:
        - %article-id-atts;  for <article-id>

              New mix PEs
        - %degrees-elements;      in <degrees>        
        - %on-behalf-of-elements; in <on-behalf-of>
        - %self-uri-elements; in <self-uri>  
        - %series-text-elements;  in <series-text>  
        - %series-title-elements; in <series-title>

     d. LINK CLASSES -  Replaced %link.class; in the PE
        -%product-elements; with the following classes 
        (no DTD change, just parameterization):
         - %simple-link.class;  (the internal links, same)
         - %article-link.class; (links for journal article)
  
  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
      
  3. Added element <label> to content model of element <author-notes>
     (via %author-notes-elements;) 
     Rationale: To allow label as a format override
  
  2. Created parameter entity %author-notes-elements; to hold 
     contents of <author-notes>
     Rationale: In order to distinguish between models used by
     the Archiving DTD and the Publishing DTD, it was necessary 
     to create a parameter entity that could be overridden.
     
  1. Added parameter entity %label.class; to parameter 
     %corresp-elements;  
     Rationale: To allow label as a format override
                                                                   -->

<!--                    Optional element, used to hold one of the
                        "unique identifiers" that have been assigned
                        at various times to an article.  Such
                        identifiers may come from the publisher, the
                        jobber, or from inside PMC. Examples of such
                        numbers are the publishers tracking number,
                        the PNAS number, etc. PMC tries to carry 
                        all identifiers associated with an article,
                        whether they came in as elements or attributes
                        on the original article.
                          The "type attribute" should only be used if
                        the type is known, for example, to identify
                        DOIs.

                        of three elements used to provide an element
                        identifier (such as a DOI). The <article-id>
                        holds an identifier for Articles. The 
                        <pub-id> element holds an identifier for  
                        cited publications, such as a journal article
                        listed inside the bibliographic reference 
                        list <ref-list>. The <object-id> holds an
                        identifier for an object such as a Figure or
                        sidebar <boxed-text>. All three elements

<!--                    GROUPING ARTICLES IN TITLED CATEGORIES
                        For some journals, articles are grouped into
                        categories, with the category indicated in
                        the article's display.
                        Sometimes the grouping or category refers
                        to the type of article, such as "Essay",
                        "Commentary", or "Article".  Sometimes the
                        grouping refers to subject areas, such as
                        "Physical Sciences", "Biological Sciences",
                        or "Social Sciences". Sometimes the grouping 
                        refers to topics within the larger subject 
                        areas, such as "Applied Math", "Biology", or 
                        "Chemistry".

                        In a printed journal as well as on the PMC
                        website, articles may be grouped or arranged
                        under these headings (here are all the
                        Essays, here are all the Biology articles,
                        etc.) Some journals divide articles into 
                        three layers of grouping, some into two, and 
                        some into only one.
                        For example, a three level grouping might be:
                         <subj-group>
                           <subject>Articles</subject>
                           <subj-group>
                             <subject>Biological Sciences</subject>
                             <subj-group>
                               <subject>Entomology</subject>
                             </subj-group>
                           </subj-group>
                         </subj-group>
                        And a one-level grouping might be
                         <subj-group>
                          <subject>Retraction</subject>
                         </subj-group>
                        or, alternatively
                         <subj-group>
                          <subject>Essay</subject>
                         </subj-group>
                         
                        Articles may also be assigned to more than 
                        one grouping. For example, if an article is
                        classified as "Biochemistry" under 
                        "Biological Sciences" and "Chemistry" under
                        "Physical Sciences," the subj-group wrapper
                        may repeat. 
                         
                        For example, 
                         <subj-group>
                           <subject>Articles</subject>
                           <subj-group>
                             <subject>Biological Sciences</subject>
                             <subj-group>
                               <subject>Biochemistry</subject>

<!--                    GROUPING ARTICLES IN SERIES
                        Series (as used in the <series-title> and

                        used in two different senses. Some issues of
                        journals are part of a series and will have
                        series information just as they have an
                        issue number as part of the article metadata,
                        to describe the issue of the journal in which
                        the article is published.  The second usage
                        is for groupings of articles within one
                        issue of a journal. For example, in some 
                        journals, articles are grouped into a
                        series such as "From the Cover" and 
                        identified as part of a series.

                        representative of the organization, which 
                        may or may not be his/her usual affiliation.
                        Related elements: Some DTDs identify this
                        category as a "collaboration", but it
                        is really more akin to a "role" the person
                        is playing with respect to the organization.

                        element <role> in describing the contribution
                        of a contributor. The <role> element will

                        "Associate Editor" and the <on-behalf-of>
                        element will state that this editing was
                        undertaken as a representative of a group
                        or organization:
