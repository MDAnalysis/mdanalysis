<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  4. NEW MIXES - To correct potential classing problems, new 
     Parameter Entities were created. The following content 
     models were changed to use these new entities.
       - <font>    %font-elements;

  3. INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Changed the inline-mix Parameter Entities to use the 
        OR-bar-first mechanism. This requires changing not
        only the Parameter Entity, but all content models that
        use the entity.
        - %emphasized-text; (used in most of the elements below)

  2. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;
  
  1. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"       
                                                                   -->

<!--                    ADVANCED UNDERLINE AND OVERLINE ELEMENTS
                        (From the Elsevier DTD, used mostly within    
                        mathematics, when ordinary MathML underline   
                        and overline functions are inadequate. The
                        elements act as milestone tags marking the
                        start and end of over or underlining that
                        may extend across element boundaries.)     -->

<!--                    OVERLINE START                             -->
<!--                    The start of a milestone-created overline, the
                        end of ornament will be marked by an
                        Overline End element.
                        Remarks:
                        The <overline-start> and <overline-end> 
                        elements enable creation of overlines in 
                        content, most commonly in mathematical 
                        content, where an normal overline tag 
                        <overline> would break the XML 
                        well-formedness rule that no two elements
                        may overlap.  The overline created using
                        these two elements can have arbitrary start 
                        and end points because the start and end 
                        elements are paired through the use of the
                        unique IDs, not as the start and end of a 
                        single element.
                        For example, in the text "ABCD", if the text
                        "ABC" is the be overlined and the text "CD" 
                        is to be underlined, ordinary overlining with
                        <overline> would create invalid tag overlap. 
                        The text could be correctly tagged, using the 
                        Overline Start and Overline End elements
                        as:
                          <overline-start id="ovl4"/>AB

                        Remarks: The <underline-start> and 
                        <underline-end> elements enable creation of 
                        underlines in content, most commonly in 
                        mathematical content, where an normal 
                        underline tag <underline> would break the
                        XML well-formedness rule that no two elements
                        may overlap.  The underline created using
                        these two elements can have arbitrary start 
                        and end points because the start and end 
                        elements are paired through the use of the
                        unique IDs, not as the start and end of a 
                        single element.
                        For example, in the text "ABCD", if the text
                        "ABC" is the be overlined and the text "CD" 
                        is to be underlined, ordinary overlining with
