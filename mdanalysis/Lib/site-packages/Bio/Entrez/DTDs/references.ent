<!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 12. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Added internal parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed 
     them from Element Declaration for:
     - %note-model;
     - %ref-list-model;
     - %ref-model;
     - and removed the parentheses for <person-group>

 11. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;

 10. REFERENCES.CLASS - Added the following elements to the
     %references.class;:
      - <issue-id>
      - <issue-title>
      - <page-range>
      - <role>
      - <string-name>
      - <volume-id>

  9. EMAIL AND URI
     a. Added to %source-elements; by changing 
         %ext-links.class; ==> %address-link.class;

  8. LOOSENING ELEMENT USAGE in Archiving DTD and Suite
     a. Rewrote content model for access-date as a new Parameter
        Entity %access-date-elements;
     b. Allowed all date components (%date-part.class;)
        inside this PE in Archiving DTD (Green) customization
     c. The default value is the empty string in this module,
        therefore, access date, by default, contains nothing 
        but #PCDATA.

  7. ROLE ELEMENT - Was added to the default references class 
     %references.class;

  6. PERSON GROUP - To add <string-name> as well as correct various
     classing problems:

     a. Content model was made into a Parameter Entity
        %person-group-model;

     b. The content model was changed to incorporate the new
         -%name.class;, which adds both <string-name> and <collab>

  5. NAME CLASS / STRING NAME
     a. Created a new element <string-name> for names that
        do not follow the former, strict personal name model.

     b. Created a new class %name.class; to hold all the ways
        to name people: <name>, <string-name>, and <collab>
        who produce products or articles. Used in:
        - <person-group>
     
     c. To allow <string-name> to be used anywhere <name> is
        used:
        - Added to default %references.class;

  4. NEW PARAMETER ENTITIES - To correct potential classing 
     problems, created the following new Parameter Entities:
     a. NEW CLASSES
        - %just-para.class; used in <annotation>, -%note-model;
        - %ref-list.class; used in <ref-list>
     b. NEW MIXES 
        - <edition>       -%edition-elements;
        - <gov>           -%gov-elements;
        - <patent>        -%patent-elements;
        - <series-title>  -%series-title-elements;
        - <std>           -%std-elements;
        - <time-stamp>    -%time-stamp-elements;


  3. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"         
     
     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  2. Added element <page-count> to parameter entity 
     %references.class;
     Rationale:  Permit tagging of page count where included in
     references.

     =============================================================
     Version 1.0 Post Publishing DTD Change (DAL) v 1.0 2003-02-10

  1. Removed <other-ref>, since the Publishing (authoring) DTD did
     not need it and that is what it had been made for. It was 
     never to be used for conversion or interchange, so it's gone.
     Removed %other-ref-elements; as well. It did not need to be 
     removed from any context, as it was never used.
                                                                   -->

                        In an unstructured reference, this text would
                        merely be data characters.
                        Typical comments could include:
                          <comment>[Abstract]</comment>

                        here largely for the sake of conversion, to
                        preserve the semantic markup when translating
                        from other DTDs.
                        Authoring and Conversion Note: The Comment
                        element should be used to mark substantive
                        text only; it should NOT be used to markup
                        punctuation that occurs between elements.
                        Display Note: Comments should appear inline
                        with other reference elements.  This is a
                        very different rendering from that given the
                        similar element Annotation, which is
                        typically a longer commentary concerning a
