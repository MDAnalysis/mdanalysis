<!--                    DTD VERSION/CHANGE HISTORY                 -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  8. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A CONTENT MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now.
     Added parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed them 
     from the Element Declarations:
     -  %article-short-model; 
     -  %article-full-model;
     -  %front-model;
     -  %body-model;
     -  %back-model;

  7. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS
     a. For the Green (Preservationist Archival) DTD, changed all 
        explicit attribute value lists to CDATA. In the future, 
        attribute value lists will be a feature of the Blue
        (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs. 
        - Added Parameter Entities to hold "date-type"
        - Changed the following attributes: 
             article-type (in %article-atts;)
     b. Removed Parameter Entity definition for
        %article-types: since it was not being used at all! 
        The attribute takes CDATA values.
     
     c. SUBARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - made into a Parameter Entity

      
  6. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. RENAME ELEMENT MIXES NOT TO END IN "-elements" 
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Names ending in "-elements" saved for the particular mixes
        that will be added to #PCDATA for a particular element,
        therefore:
        -  %doc-back-matter-elements; ==> %doc-back-matter-mix;

     b. FRONT MATTER MODEL - rewritten to use new class Parameter
        Entity %front-back.class; and to use %list.class; rather 
        than just <def-list>. This widens the model of Front Matter
        by adding <list>.
     
  5. REMODULARIZATION - The entire Archiving and Interchange DTD
     Suite was remodularized. Replaced the previous single Archiving
     customization module (archivecustomize.ent) with the
     following single-function customization modules:
       - archivecustom-modules.ent (DTD-specific module naming)
       - archivecustom-classes.ent (DTD-specific classes over-rides)
       - default.classes (Default classes declarations)
       - archivecustom-mixes.ent (DTD-specific mixes over-rides)
       - default-mixes (Default mixes declarations)
       - archivecustom-models.ent (DTD-specific content model 
         over-rides to the base Suite) 
            There are two types of such over-rides. One that 
            replaces a complete content model (which are named with a 
            suffix "-model") and those that are OR groups of 
            elements, intended to be mixed with #PCDATA inside 
            a particular model (which are named with an "-elements" 
            suffix).
  
  4. VERSION 2.0 - Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" on 
     this module and the module-of-modules module and changed the
     "dtd-version" fixed attribute to reference latest version 
     of DTD (version "2.0").

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  3. Updated public identifier to "v1.1 20031101"

  2. Changed Parameter Entity %dtd-version; to reference latest
     version of DTD (version 1.1)

  1. Updated public identifiers for modules.ent and 
     archivecustomize.ent to reflect modules' modification.
     Rationale: To call updated modules.
                                                                   -->

<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange 
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for 
                        publishing, interchange, and repository 
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for 
                        specific purposes, such as this Journal 
                        Archiving and Interchange DTD, would be 
                        developed based on them.
                         
                        This archiving DTD has been designed to  
                        be descriptive, open, and inclusive to 
                        allow journal articles to be translated into  
                        this format as conveniently as possible
                        from a wide variety of proprietary journal
                        article DTDs (such as Blackwell, Keton, and
                        Ovid).
                       
                        This Archiving DTD has been developed from
                        the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                        modules, in the approved manner, making 
                        changes to the declarations in those modules 
                        by over-riding Parameter Entity contents 
                        by redefining the entities in the  
                            %archivecustomize.ent;
                        module, which is called from this DTD file. 
                        No changes to any of the original Archiving 
                        and Interchange Suite modules are required 
                        in order to use this DTD.                  -->

<!-- THE MANY ROADS NOT TAKEN
                        In the interest of getting a version of this
                        DTD into production as quickly as practical,
                        several structures and functions that might
                        be appropriately included have been delayed 
                        until a future version of this DTD. Such 
                        components include:
                          - Questions and Answers (These may be 
                              modeled with the current DTDs by using 
                              paragraphs and lists)
                          - Continuing Medical Education material
                             (which frequently contains questions 
                             and answers)
                          - Forms and fill-in-the-blank
                          - Conflict of Interest statements and
                              Financial Disclosure (May be modeled
                              as paragraphs or footnotes)
                          - Electronic and Digital Rights Management
                          - Advertising included in the journal:
                                + Job ads
                                + Classified advertising
                                + Display advertising
                          - Calendars, meeting schedules, and 
                              announcements.  (These can be handled 
                              as ordinary articles or sections within

             dtd-version 
                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
                        Processing and Conversion Note: All other
                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on <article> unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      
             xmlns      Set up the pseudo-attributes for the
                        namespaces for any namespaces used in this
                        DTD.  XLink and MathML are set up in the
                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.
                        The PEs are defined in the MathML modules. -->

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).

<!--                    Reply, response, or commentary concerning the
                        journal article. In the typical case, the
                        response is included in the same XML package 
                        as the original article, and thus attached 
                        at the end of the article proper.
                        Authoring Note: Frequently a reply or
                        response is an article in its own right, not
                        included as part of the original article.
                        Such an article could use the 
                        <related-article> element in the article 
                        metadata to record the metadata for the 
                        original article.     
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an 
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                -->

                        article on which the response is commenting,
                        it is metadata for the response itself.

                        being chained together as an introduction,
