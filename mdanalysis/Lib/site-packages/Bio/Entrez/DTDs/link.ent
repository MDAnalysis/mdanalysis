     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
          
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  9. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     -  %fn-model; 

  8. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;

  7. FOOTNOTE
        - Made model into a Parameter Entity
        - Added optional <label> to the beginning of the model,
          before the paragraphs

  6. To correct potential classing problems, used the following
     new Parameter Entities:
        - %just-para.class; used in <fn> (%fn-model; uses 
          %just-para.class;)

  5. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                         (TRG/BTU) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  4. Added "alternate-form-of", "content-type", and ID attributes 
     to <inline-supplementary-material> (by modifying 
     %inline-supplementary-material-atts;)
     Rationale: To provide parallelism between attributes for 
     <supplementary-material> and <inline-supplementary-material>

  3. Added "mimetype" and "mime-subtype" attributes to 
     <inline-supplementary-material> (as part of adding these 
     attributes to all graphic and multi-media elements)

  2. Added ID attribute information to <xref> (by modifying
     parameter entity %xref-atts;)
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so <xref>
     element can be linked to (creating two-way link). 

  1. Added an optional "target-type" attribute to element 
     <target>.  Rationale: To identify the reason for this target.
                                                                   -->
