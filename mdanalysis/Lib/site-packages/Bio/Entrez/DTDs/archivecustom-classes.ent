Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
          
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  6. STRING-NAME
     Added <string-name> everywhere <name> was allowed before

  5. CONTRIBUTOR / CONTRIBUTOR GROUP
     a. <etal> added to %contrib-info.class;, strict sequence after
        the contributor name no longer enforced.
        
     b. <uri> and <fn> added to %contrib-info.class;
        
     c. Added <x> (generated punctuation) to:
         - <contributor> (through %x.class;)
         - <contributor-group>  (through %x.class;)
     
  4. <x> GENERATED TEXT AND PUNCTUATION ELEMENT ADDED TO
     - <kwd-group> by way of %keyword-group-model;
     - <def-list> by way of %def-list-model;
     - <def-item> by way of %def-item-model;
     - <article-meta> by way of %article-meta-model;
     - <contributor> and <contributor-group> (via %contrib-model;
       and %contrib-group-model;)
     - <person-group> by way of %person-group-model;
     - <x> was added to everywhere the %references.class; was used, 
       though NOT by adding it to the class itself.
      
  3. DOI/ID - in view of the larger role that some publishers
     are giving to DOIs, a new class Parameter Entity %id.class;
     was established that holds the new element Object Identifier
     <object-id>, which can be used to capture any publisher's or 
     archive's ID. This was modeled as an element rather than as 
     an attribute to allow for multiple IDs. Used in:
      - %references.class (therefore inside <citation>, 
           <related-article>, and <product>)
        
  2. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix. Changed the names 
     to add the class suffix:
      - %contrib-info.class;
                
  1. Created this module as version "v2.0 20040830"                -->

                        semicolons between keywords.
                        This textual material element has been 
                        created:
                         - to match existing input DTDs
                         - to identify such material, so that it
                             can be processed (such as removed)
                         - to try to remove look-and-feel material
                             from semantic material such as keywords.
                                                                   -->
