<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  9. PARAGRAPH ELEMENT MODELING
     ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Changed the model of paragraph to use #PCDATA and
        %p-elements; like all other #PCDATA models
     b. Changed the inline-mix to use the OR-bar-first
        mechanism.
         - %inside-para;  [Now renamed -%p-elements;]
           (used only inside Paragraph <p>)

  8. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Added internal parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed 
     them from Element Declaration for:
     - %disp-quote-model;
     - %statement-model;
 
  7. RENAMED CLASSES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
     following to add the suffix:
     - %display-back-matter.class; used in: 
        - <disp-quote>
        - <verse-group>

  6. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;

  5. NEW CLASSES - To correct potential classing problems, created
     the following new Parameter Entities:
        - %just-para.class; used in <speech>, <statement-model>
        - %verse-group-model; for <verse-group>
        - %verse-line-elements; for <verse-line>

  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"         

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
      
  3. Added attribute "content-type" to elements <p>, <speech> and 
     <statement>.  
     Rationale: To identify and preserve the semantic intent of 
     semantically rich source documents.
     
  2. Added ID attribute to elements <p>, <speech>, <disp-quote>,
     and <verse-group>. 
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so these elements can be 
     linked to.

     Version 1.0 Changes Before Public Release
                                       (Lapeyre) V1.0 (2002-12-25)

  1. DIALOG/SPEECH - Element <dialog> renamed <speech>  
                                                                   -->

<!--                    PARAMETER ENTITY DEPENDENCIES             
                        Requires the following parameter entities
                        be defined before calling this module, 
                        usually accomplished in the Customization

<!--                    PARAGRAPH ELEMENTS                         -->
<!--                    The elements that can be included along with
                        data characters inside the content model of
                        a paragraph <p>. 
                        DESIGN NOTE: There is a major overlap between 
                        this parameter entity and the mix for elements
                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a 
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes 
                        and lists may appear either within a 
                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only 
                        inside a paragraph, some incoming material 
                        will have restricted them to only outside a 
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      
                        DESIGN NOTE: Inline mixes begin with an
