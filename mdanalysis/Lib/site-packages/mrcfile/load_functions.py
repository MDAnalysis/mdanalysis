    ``w+``) but the :func:`new` function is more flexible.
    
    This function offers a permissive read mode for attempting to open corrupt
    or invalid files. In permissive mode, :mod:`warnings` are issued instead of
    exceptions if problems with the file are encountered. See

            for read-only, ``r+`` for read and write, or ``w+`` for a new empty
            file. The default is ``r``.
        permissive: Read the file in permissive mode. The default is
            :data:`False`.
        header_only: Only read the header (and extended header) from the file.

    This allows a file to be opened in the background while the main thread
    continues with other work. This can be a good way to improve performance if
    the main thread is busy with intensive computation, but will be less
    effective if the main thread is itself busy with disk I/O.

    Multiple files can be opened in the background simultaneously. However,
    this implementation is relatively crude; each call to this function will
    start a new thread and immediately use it to start opening a file. If you
    try to open many large files at the same time, performance will decrease as
    all of the threads attempt to access the disk at once. You'll also risk
    running out of memory to store the data from all the files.

    This function returns a :class:`~mrcfile.future_mrcfile.FutureMrcFile`
    object, which deliberately mimics the API of the
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` object from Python 3's
    :mod:`concurrent.futures` module. (Future versions of this library might
    return genuine :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` objects instead.)

    To get the real :class:`~mrcfile.mrcfile.MrcFile` object from a
    :class:`~mrcfile.future_mrcfile.FutureMrcFile`, call
    :meth:`~mrcfile.future_mrcfile.FutureMrcFile.result`. This will block until

    This function is useful for creating very large files. The initial contents
    of the data array can be set with the ``fill`` parameter if needed, but be
    aware that filling a large array can take a long time.

    If ``fill`` is not set, the new data array's contents are unspecified and
    system-dependent. (Some systems fill a new empty mmap with zeros, others
    fill it with the bytes from the disk at the newly-mapped location.) If you
    are definitely going to fill the entire array with new data anyway you can
    safely leave ``fill`` as :data:`None`, otherwise it is advised to use a

        shape: The shape of the data array to open, as a 2-, 3- or 4-tuple of
            ints. For example, ``(nz, ny, nx)`` for a new 3D volume, or
            ``(ny, nx)`` for a new 2D image.
        mrc_mode: The MRC mode to use for the new file. One of 0, 1, 2, 4 or 6,
            which correspond to numpy dtypes as follows:

            * mode 0 -> int8

            are unspecified. Numpy's usual rules for rounding or rejecting
            values apply, according to the dtype of the array.

            is not overwritten and an exception is raised.
