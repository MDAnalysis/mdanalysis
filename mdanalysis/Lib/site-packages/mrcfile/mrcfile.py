    """An object which represents an MRC file.
    
    The header and data are handled as numpy arrays - see
    :class:`~mrcfile.mrcobject.MrcObject` for details.
        
    :class:`MrcFile` supports a permissive read mode for attempting to open
    corrupt or invalid files. See
    :class:`mrcfile.mrcinterpreter.MrcInterpreter` or the :doc:`usage guide
    <../usage_guide>` for more information.
    
    Usage:
        To create a new MrcFile object, pass a file name and optional mode. To
        ensure the file is written to disk and closed correctly, it's best to
        use the :keyword:`with` statement:
        
        >>> with MrcFile('tmp.mrc', 'w+') as mrc:
        ...     mrc.set_data(np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=np.int8))
        
        In mode ``r`` or ``r+``, the named file is opened from disk and read.
        In mode ``w+`` a new empty file is created and will be written to disk
        at the end of the :keyword:`with` block (or when
        :meth:`~.MrcInterpreter.flush` or :meth:`close` is called).

        The given file name is opened in the given mode. For mode ``r`` or
        ``r+`` the header, extended header and data are read from the file. For
        mode ``w+`` a new file is created with a default header and empty
        extended header and data arrays.
        
        Args:
            name: The file name to open, as a string or pathlib Path.
            mode: The file mode to use. This should be one of the following:
                ``r`` for read-only, ``r+`` for read and write, or ``w+`` for a
                new empty file. The default is ``r``.
            overwrite: Flag to force overwriting of an existing file if the
                mode is ``w+``. If :data:`False` and a file of the same name
                already exists, the file is not overwritten and an exception is
                raised. The default is :data:`False`.

            :exc:`ValueError`: If the file is not a valid MRC file and
                ``permissive`` is :data:`False`.
            :exc:`ValueError`: If the mode is ``w+``, the file already exists
                and overwrite is :data:`False`.
            :exc:`OSError`: If the mode is ``r`` or ``r+`` and the file does

           also valid according to the MRC 2014 specification but are not
           supported by mrcfile.)

           ``mx``, ``my``, ``mz``, ``cella.x``, ``cella.y`` and ``cella.z``
           must all be positive numbers.

           contain the values 1, 2, and 3 (in any order).
        #. Volume stack dimensions: If the spacegroup is in the range 401--630,
           representing a volume stack, the ``nz`` field should be exactly
           divisible by ``mz`` to represent the number of volumes in the stack.

           number of labels in use, and the labels in use should appear first
           in the label array.
        #. MRC format version: The ``nversion`` field should be 20140 or 20141
           for compliance with the MRC2014 standard.
        #. Extended header type: If an extended header is present, the
           ``exttyp`` field should be set to indicate the type of extended
           header.
        #. Data statistics: The statistics in the header should be correct for
           the actual data in the file, or marked as undetermined.

           size calculated from the MRC header.
