MDAnalysis CHANGELOG
====================

The rules for this file:
  * entries are sorted newest-first.
  * summarize sets of changes - dont reproduce every subversion log comment here.
  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
??/??/10 orbeckst 
        (Running list of enhancements, to be edited for final
        entry when stable changes are merged back into trunk)

        * reads hydrogen bond donor/acceptor list from psf and sets up
          structures for hydrogen bonding analysis
          TODO: H-BOND ANALYSIS NOT WORKING YET

05/xx/10 orbeckst
        * 0.6.2 release
        * defined trajectory API
        * deprecated DCD.dcd_header --> DCD._dcd_header
	* XTC and TRR compute numframes by iterating through trajectory (slow!)
	* introduced units: base units are ps (time) and Angstrom (length); see core.flags
	* XTC and TRR automatically convert between native Gromacs units (ps, nm) and 
          base units (uses core.flags['convert_gromacs_lengths'] = True)
	* more test cases
	

04/30/10 orbeckst

        * 0.6.1 release
	* can build a simple Universe from a PDB file (FIXES Issue 11)
        * can read Gromacs XTC and TRR files (FIXES Issue 1) but no
	  Timeseries or Collections yet for those formats
	* removed Universe.load_new_dcd() and Universe.load_new_pdb()
	  --- use the generic Universe.load_new() (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
        * removed deprecated Universe._dcd attribute (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
        * FIXED bug in PDB.PDBWriter and CRD.CRDWriter
        * use SloppyPDB in order to cope with large PDB files
	* core.distances.self_distance_array() is now behaving the
	  same way as distance_array()
        * defined Trajectory API (see MDAnalysis/coordinates/__init__.py)
	* renamed _dcdtest to dcdtimeseries (will not affect old code)
	* unit tests added (still need more test cases)

03/31/10 orbeckst, denniej0 
        * 0.6.0 release
        * added KDTree and Neighbour searching code from Biopython for
          faster distance selections: used for AROUND selections;
	  POINT is using distance matrix by default as this is
	  faster. This can be configured with core.flags
	* core.flags infrastructure to tweak behaviour at run time
        * updated LICENSE file with Biopython License
 	* some selections for nucleic acids
        * completely reorganized directory structure to make
          enhancements easier to incorporate
	* FIXED (partial): Issue 18 (Timeseries from a universe.segID
          selection, reported by lordnapi)
        * FIXED: Issue 19 (Timeseries collections were broken,
          reported by Jiyong)
        * can write single frames as pdb or crd (AtomGroup gained the
          write() method)
	* some selections for nucleic acids
        * completely reorganized directory structure to make
          enhancements easier to incorporate
        * FIXED: Issue 19 (Timeseries collections were broken)
        * improved installation
          - EasyInstall (setuptools) support (FIXED Issue 16)
	  - better instructions in INSTALL
          - slightly better handling of the configuration of the fast
            linear algebra libs via the setup.cfg file



08/23/08 naveen, orbeckst
        * 0.5.1 release
	* primitive PDB writer (only works if coordinates were read from a pdb)
        * B-factor property (detailed implementation subject to change)
        * periodic flag for PointSelection
	* new correl series: orientation vector for 3-site molecules
	  (to calculate the water dipole moment of SPC or TIP3P)
	* distance.distance_array() bug fixed (see doc string)
        * updated LICENSE file UIUC Open Source License

01/29/08 orbeckst
	* prepared 0.5.0 release. Includes previously disabled
	  distance code, PDB reader, incomplete XTC reader (code by
	  Benjamin Hall), and marginally updated documentation &
	  licenses

11/12/07 naveen
        * prepared for release outside lab
