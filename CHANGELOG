	  (Issue 64)

02/08/11 orbeckst, denniej0, jandom, tyler.je.reddy, Joshua Adelman
        * 0.7.1 release
        * online documentation
        * AMBER topology and trj capabilities (netcdf not yet available)
        * PQR file reading support
        * new analysis.contacts.ContactAnalysis1 class that supports a
	  native contact analysis between arbitrary groups     
        * new examples (e.g. peptide helix clustering in a membrane)
	* fixed Issue 58 (align.rms_fit_trj; fix reported by Joshua
  	  Adelman)
	* new analysis module 'density': creation and analysis of volume data
        * fast RMSD aligner based on Douglas Theobald's QCP method for
	  calculating the minimum RMSD between two structures and
	  determining the optimal least-squares rotation matrix;
	  replaces the slower previous code (implemented by Joshua Adelman from
	  his pyqcprot package https://github.com/synapticarbors/pyqcprot);
	  deprecated core.rms_fitting.rms_rotation_matrix() and scheduled for
          removal in 0.8
        * uses cython instead of pyrex

11/05/10 orbeckst, denniej0, tyler.je.reddy, danny.parton, joseph.goose
        * major release 0.7.0
          (includes changes that can BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY)
        * Removed ALL DEPRECATED code:
	  - AtomGroup.principleAxes (Issue 33)
	  - DCD.DCDReader.dcd_header() and DCD.DCDWriter.dcd_header()
	    (use _dcd_header())
          - Universe.dcd (and Universe.xtc, Universe.trr...) --- from
  	    now on only Universe.trajectory is supported. 
	    WILL BREAK LEGACY CODE!
          - removed the following packages from top-level MDAnalysis
 	    name space:
            - AtomGroup, Selection: import them from MDAnalysis.core if
	      really needed (e.g. 'import MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup')
	    - distances, rms_fitting: 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.distances'
              or 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rms_fitting' (the
	      actual modules still live in MDAnalysis.core but they
	      might get moved in the future and bundled with
	      transformations)
            - 'from MDAnalysis import *' will only get ['Timeseries',
	      'Universe', 'asUniverse', 'Writer', 'collection']
          - removed copy flag from distance_array and self_distance_array:
            setting it to False would always give wrong results so there was
            no good reason keeping it around 
	* whitespace is no longer required around parentheses for 
	  selectAtoms strings but the old syntax with white space
	  still works (Issue 43)
	* improved trajectory writing
           - MDAnalysis.Writer() factory function that provides an
             appropriate writer for the desired file format
	   - Writer.write() accepts a Timestep, a Universe, or a 
	     arbitrary AtomGroup (e.g. from a selection); this is much
	     more flexible than Writer.write_next_timestep()
        * New attributes for trajectory readers: dt (time between
  	  frames) and totaltime (length of the trajectory)
        * Changes to AtomGroup
          - Indexing is made consistent with the way lists behave:
            1. indexing with integers returns a single Atom
	    2. slicing always returns a new AtomGroup
	    3. advanced slicing with a list or array returns a new
	       AtomGroup (NEW, fixes Issue 36) 
	  - AtomGroup coordinates can be manipulated (translate(),
            rotate() and rotateby() methods; when appropriate, these methods
	    can take AtomGroups or arrays to determine coordinates)
	  - new attributes 'residues' and 'segments' for AtomGroup to give 
	    access to the list of residue/segment objects of the group 
	  - new exception 'NoDataError'; raised when creation of an empty
	    AtomGroup is attempted (see also Issue 12)
          - consistent representation of the Segment > Residue > Atom
	    hierarchy: all classes related to AtomGroup have the
	    attributes 'atoms', 'residues', 'segments' which provide
	    access to groups of the corresponding objects
	* improvements to Residue, ResidueGroup and Segment classes 
	  - documented accessing residues from Segment as
	    Segment.r<resid>; resid is 1-based -- BREAKS OLD CODE 
	    that relied on this being 0-based
          - added SegmentGroup class
	  - can write from Residue, ResidueGroup and Segment (Issue 46)
	  - residue name attribute of a Segment now consistently
	    returns a ResidueGroup (Issue 47) -- MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE
	  - added documentation and examples in the doc strings
	  - new special dihedral angle selections defined for Residue
	    class to simplify analysis of backbone torsions (experimental)
	* new contact_matrix method for calculating contacts 
	  (Issue 30); for large (N > ~10000) coordinate arrays
	  automatically switches to a method using a sparse matrix
	  (slower)
        * more example scripts (e.g. for membrane analysis, trajectory writing,
	  coordinate transformations)
	* CRDReader added (fixes  Issue 40 ) ... it will work for both
	  standard and extended formats: NO special flags needed. 
        * CRDWriter will now write extended crd files: NO special flags needed.  
        * By default, PDB files are read with the PrimitivePDBReader and not
	  the Bio.PDB reader anymore because the latter can drop atoms when
	  they have the same name in a residue (which happens for systems
	  generated from MD simulations) The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine
	  with those cases (but does not handle esoteric PDB features such as
	  alternative atoms and insertion codes that are not needed for
	  handling MD simulation data).  
	  - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis  can be set through the flag
	       MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader'] 
            The default is True.  
          - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the
	    permissive keyword to Universe; e.g. Universe(...,permissive=False)
	    will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be
	    useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.
        * fixed Issue 51 (distance_array() did not properly check its
          input and wrong results could be returned if the input was a
          float64 and a float32 array)

09/19/10 orbeckst
	* quick-fix release 0.6.4.1
	* fixed import issue with python 2.5 (Issue 41)

09/16/10 orbeckst, danny.parton
	* release 0.6.4
	* GRO writer added
	* fixed XTC writer (Issue 38)
	* convert box representations (Issue 37)
	* primitive PDB parser added (slightly faster and ignores
	  correctness of resids, atomnames etc but reads CRYST1 into unitcell)
	* Universe gained the 'permissive' flag to switch on the
	  primitive PDB parser/reader
	* Simple 'chained reader' which enables a Universe to
	  transparently read a list of trajectory files (Issue 39).
        * Additional methods for AtomGroup: numberOfResidues(),
	  resids(), resnames()
        * new bilayer analysis script for membrane composition on a
	  per-leaflet basis (examples/membrane-composition.py); also
	  renamed examples/leaflet.py to membrane-leaflets.py

07/08/10 orbeckst, denniej0, danny.parton, philipwfowler
	* 0.6.3 release
        * minimum requirement is python 2.4 (using with_statement in the
          analysis module and we have not tested on 2.3 in a while)
        * analysis modules (MDAnalysis.analysis):
          - lipid bilayer leaflet detection
          - native contact analysis ("q1-q2")
	  - rms-fitting based on sequence alignment
        * write selections for other codes from AtomGroups (VMD, pymol, CHARMM,
          Gromacs ndx)
        * gro reader (Issue 31)
	* better API for loading a topology and a coordinate file in Universe()
        * trajectory reader: DCDReader can reverse trajectory with negative
          step increment; XTC/TRRReader can do simple (forward) slices by doing
          (slow!) sequential iteration
        * deprecated principleAxes() and introduced principalAxes() with less
          confusing return values (Issue 33).
	* fixed wrong unitcell dimensions for XTC/TRR (Issue 34)
 	* added basic XYZ reader with compression support (Issue 35)
	* PDB reader guesses masses (unknown elements are set to 0)
	* installation requires Biopython (www.biopython.org)
 
05/28/10 orbeckst, denniej0
        * 0.6.2 release
	* removed a number of imports from the top level (such as rms_fitting);
  	  this might break some scripts that still rely on the layout that was
  	  used for 0.5.x (which is now officially declared deprecated)
        * defined trajectory API
        * deprecated DCD.dcd_header --> DCD._dcd_header
	* XTC and TRR compute numframes by iterating through trajectory (slow!)
	* introduced units: base units are ps (time) and Angstrom (length); see core.flags
	* XTC and TRR automatically convert between native Gromacs units (ps, nm) and 
          base units (uses core.flags['convert_gromacs_lengths'] = True)
	* more test cases
        * *really* FIXED Issue 16 (can easy_install from tar file)
	* FIXED a bug in AtomGroup.principalAxes()
	* added dependency information to setup.py (numpy and
  	  biopython by default; nose for tests)

04/30/10 orbeckst

        * 0.6.1 release
	* can build a simple Universe from a PDB file (FIXES Issue 11)
        * can read Gromacs XTC and TRR files (FIXES Issue 1) but no
	  Timeseries or Collections yet for those formats
	* removed Universe.load_new_dcd() and Universe.load_new_pdb()
	  --- use the generic Universe.load_new() (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
        * removed deprecated Universe._dcd attribute (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
        * FIXED bug in PDB.PDBWriter and CRD.CRDWriter
        * use SloppyPDB in order to cope with large PDB files
	* core.distances.self_distance_array() is now behaving the
	  same way as distance_array()
        * defined Trajectory API (see MDAnalysis/coordinates/__init__.py)
	* renamed _dcdtest to dcdtimeseries (will not affect old code)
	* unit tests added (still need more test cases)

03/31/10 orbeckst, denniej0 
        * 0.6.0 release
        * added KDTree and Neighbour searching code from Biopython for
          faster distance selections: used for AROUND selections;
	  POINT is using distance matrix by default as this is
	  faster. This can be configured with core.flags
	* core.flags infrastructure to tweak behaviour at run time
        * updated LICENSE file with Biopython License
 	* some selections for nucleic acids
        * completely reorganized directory structure to make
          enhancements easier to incorporate
	* FIXED (partial): Issue 18 (Timeseries from a universe.segID
          selection, reported by lordnapi)
        * FIXED: Issue 19 (Timeseries collections were broken,
          reported by Jiyong)
        * can write single frames as pdb or crd (AtomGroup gained the
          write() method)
	* some selections for nucleic acids
        * completely reorganized directory structure to make
          enhancements easier to incorporate
        * FIXED: Issue 19 (Timeseries collections were broken)
        * improved installation
          - EasyInstall (setuptools) support (FIXED Issue 16)
	  - better instructions in INSTALL
          - slightly better handling of the configuration of the fast
            linear algebra libs via the setup.cfg file



08/23/08 naveen, orbeckst
