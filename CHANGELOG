        * 0.6.1 release
        * FIXED bug in PDB.PDBWriter

03/31/10 orbeckst, denniej0 

        * 0.6.0 release
        * added KDTree and Neighbour searching code from Biopython for
          faster distance selections: used for AROUND selections;
	  POINT is using distance matrix by default as this is
	  faster. This can be configured with core.flags
	* core.flags infrastructure to tweak behaviour at run time
        * updated LICENSE file with Biopython License
        * can write single frames as pdb or crd (AtomGroup gained the
          write() method)
	* some selections for nucleic acids
        * completely reorganized directory structure to make
          enhancements easier to incorporate
	* FIXED (partial): Issue 18 (Timeseries from a universe.segID
          selection, reported by lordnapi)
        * FIXED: Issue 19 (Timeseries collections were broken,
          reported by Jiyong)
        * improved installation
          - EasyInstall (setuptools) support (FIXED Issue 16)
	  - better instructions in INSTALL
          - slightly better handling of the configuration of the fast
            linear algebra libs via the setup.cfg file

	* new correl series: orientation vector for 3-site molecules
	  (to calculate the water dipole moment of SPC or TIP3P)
	* distance.distance_array() bug fixed (see doc string)
        * updated LICENSE file UIUC Open Source License

01/29/08 orbeckst
