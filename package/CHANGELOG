    SelectionError when selections are incompatible (Issue #1809)
  * fix cython 0.28 compiler error

  * 0.11.0

  This release brings large changes to many parts of the API and might
  break many existing scripts. For a full guide on the API changes,
  please see:

  https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/MDAnalysis-0.11-unifying-release-user-guide

  Migrating old scripts has been made easier with the introduction of
  the ten2eleven tool which is part of the package.
  Details on how to use this are available at:

  https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Migrating-MDAnalysis-code-with-ten2eleven.py

  API Changes

  * Changed AtomGroup counting methods to properties with different
    names: numberOfAtoms() to n_atoms, numberOfResidues() to
    n_residues, numberOfSegments() --> n_segments (Issue #376)
  * Changed trajectory reader numframes to n_frames (Issue #376)
  * Changed Timestep.numatoms to n_atoms (Issue #376)
  * Deprecated the use of the 'fullgroup' selection keyword (Issue #268)

    represents the number of atoms) (Issue #250)
  * Added from_timestep and from_coordinates construction methods
    to base.Timestep (Issue #250)
  * Removed KDTree and CoordinateNeighbor from MDAnalaysis. If you
    want to search in cartesian coordinates directly for nighboring
    points use the BioPython KDTree or scikit-learn Neighbors module.
    The AtomNeighborSearch class has been ported to use the BioPython
    KDTree and is now located in MDAnalaysis.lib.NeighborSearch.
    MDAnalaysis.KDTree still exists in this version so load the
    NeighborSearch module but is deprecated and will be removed in
    1.0. (Issue #383)

    (Issue #385)
  * AtomGroup setters `set_<property>` now plural for consistency with
    property names (Issue #385)
  * DCDReader no longer supports the "skip" keyword.  Use slicing
    on reader iteration to achieve same affect. (Issue #350)

    originally created with these through the use of the has_ flags.
    (Issue #213)

  * MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.Merge now copies across bonding
    information (Issue #249)

  Changes

  * numpy >= 1.5 required
  * A ProtoReader class intermediate between IObase and Reader was added
    so specific Readers can be subclassed without __del__ (the
    ChainReader and SingleFrameReader), thus preventing memleaks
    (Issue #312).
  * Atoms (and all container classes thereof) are now bound to Universes
    only via weakrefs. If Universes are not explicitly kept in scope
    Atoms will become orphaned. (Issue #297)

  * moved MDAnalysis.selections.base.get_writer() to
    MDAnalysis.selections.get_writer() to break a circular import. This
    should not affect any code because
    MDAnalysis.selections.get_writer() already existed.
  * distances.contact_matrix now treats the particle distance with
    itself as a contact for sparse matrices and numpy arrays. The
    progress reporting for sparse calculations has been removed.

    argument to consider periodic boundary conditions in their calculation
    (Issue 172)
  * TopologyGroup angles and torsions methods both have a pbc flag, (default
    False) to toggle consideration of periodic boundaries
  * XYZWriter (write simple XYZ trajectories)
  * TRZReader upgrades, seeking and numframes faster
  * PQRWriter (write PQR files)
  * HydrogenBond analysis: new keyword distance_type to alternatively
    look at the distance between heavy atoms (Issue 185)
  * TopologyGroup/TopologyDict system overhauled. (Issue 194)
  * TopologyObject class created, Bonds/Angles/etc nicer to work with.
  * Topology information is now loaded lazily into Universe, can be forced to
    load all with u.load_topology(). All topology information is now stored in
    .bonds .angles .torsions and .impropers attributes.
  * Added support for improper torsions.
  * AtomGroup now has .bonds .angles .torsions and .impropers attributes which
    retrieve relevant TopologyGroups
  * Increased performance of topology.core.guess_bonds greatly
  * Added topology.core.guess_angles guess_torsions and guess_improper_torsions
    which given accurate bond information can calculate the rest of the
    topology info.
  * Universe topology information is now settable after initialisation using lists of indices
    such as those provided by the guess_* functions.
  * Added LAMMPS data parser for topology files with the .data suffix. Can also
    read single frame coordinate & velocity information from these files.
    (Issue 139)
  * Added Fragments.  Fragments are continuously bonded groups of atoms.
    These are lazily built, and accessible via the Atom.fragment and AtomGroup.fragments
    attributes.
    (Issue 190)
  * Added ability to remove items from Universe cache with _clear_caches.
  * Added ability to define dimensions from AtomGroup, Universe and Timestep for most
    formats.
    (Issue 203)
  * streamIO: many readers can directly use gzip- or bzip2 compressed
    files or a stream (such as cStringIO.StringIO) wrapped in
    util.NamedStream; currently supported: PDB, PSF, CRD, PQR, PDBQT,
    GRO, MOL2, XYZ
  * Added hydrogen bonding time autocorrelation analysis module
    (analysis.hbonds.HydrogenBondAutoCorrel)
  * Added energy units to core.units (Issue 214)
  * New AtomGroup.split() method to produce a list of AtomGroups for each atom,
    residue, or segment
  * New AtomGroup.sequence() method to extract a protein sequence.
  * Can pass subclasses of Reader and Topology reader to Universe init to allow
    custom readers to be defined. (Issue 198)
  * Added Atom.bonded_atoms property.  This returns an AtomGroup of the Atoms
    that are bonded to a given Atom. (Issue 219)
  * Added atom selections to ContactAnalysis (Issue 169)


  Changes

  * DCD unitcell format changed: MDAnalysis will now read it as [A,
    gamma, B, beta, alpha, C] instead of [A, alpha, B, beta, gamma,
    C]. The new CHARMM box vector unitcell format is heuristically guessed.
    (see Issue 187 for a full discussion and implications).
  * __getstate__() and __setstate__() raise an NotImplementedError for
    Universe and AtomGroup; before they were silently accepted on
    pickling and a cryptic "TypeError: AtomGroup is not callable" was
    raised (see also Issue 173 for detailed explanation)
  * XTC/TRR reader raise IOError with errorcode EIO (instead of
    ENODATA) when the last frame is reached and EBADF (instead of
    EFAULT) for any other issues (partially addresses Issue 150,
    Windows compatibility)
  * Universe.bonds now returns a TopologyGroup not a list.  TopologyGroup can be
    iterated over; list(universe.bonds) should provide a fix to legacy code.
  * PQR reader will now set segid to a chainID if found in the PQR
    file (previously, the segid would always be set to 'SYSTEM').
  * util.anyopen() only returns the stream and not the tuple (stream,
    filename) anymore; it tries to set stream.name instead
  * topology reading now done via classes (similar to trajectory reading)
    rather than functions.
    (Issue 210)


  Fixes

  * fixed DCD triclinic unit cell reading and writing (although the new CHARMM
    format with the box matrix is not supported for writing) (Issue 187)
    ATTENTION: Support for triclinic boxes from DCDs was BROKEN prior to this fix!
  * fixed creation of residues and segments in Merge()
  * resolves Issue 188 regarding Helanal Finish Argument
  * fixed Issue 184 (TPR files with double precision)
  * fixed Issue 199 (FutureWarning in pyqcprot)

  * 0.8.1

  (Note: 0.8.0 contains a subset of these changes; 0.8.0 is deprecated)

  Enhancements

  * Named selections can now be passed to selectAtoms (Issue 174)
  * (experimental) MDAnalysis.visualization namespace added along with
    2D/3D streamplot modules & documentation for them

    information when reading and writing frames.
  * MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts.ContactAnalysis1 run() method
    now allows trajectory slicing (Issue 161)
  * Merge AtomGroups into a new Universe (Issue 157)
  * TPR parser (currently limited to versions 58, 73 and 83 of the
    Gromacs TPR format (Gromacs 4.0 to 4.6.1), see Issue 2)
  * fast XTC seeking (Issue 127)
  * changing resid (set_resid()) or segid (set_segid()) changes the
    topology and lists of resids/segids can be assigned to
    groups of objects (AtomGroup, ResidueGroup)
  * helanal: additional output of local bend and unit twist angles
    (Issue 133)
  * added support for reading DMS files (DESRES molecular structure)
  * bond connectivity information can be guessed from a PDB file if
    the bond=True keyword is set in Universe (Issue 23)
  * MDAnalysis.analysis.rms.RMSD: calculation of additional RMSDs
  * Plugin to generate nucleic acid helicoidal parameters using X3DNA;
    (must install working version 2.1 of X3DNA independently)
  * can use advanced slicing (with arbitrary lists or arrays) at all
    levels of the hierarchy (Issue 148)
  * coordinate readers and writers can be used as context managers
    with the 'with' statement
  * Can load multiple trajectories as Universe(topology, traj2, traj2,
    ...) in addition to providing all trajectories as a list,
    i.e. Universe(topology, [traj1, traj2, ...])
  * added support for YASP and IBIsCO formats (.trz) (Issue 152)
  * new methods for AtomGroup: packIntoBox([inplace=True])
  * added non-standard "extended" PDB format (XPDB) that reads
    five-digit residue numbers
  * util.convert_aa_code() recognizes non-standard residue names such
    as HSE, GLUH, GLH, ...
  * added new geometrics selections: sphlayer, sphzone, cylayer, cyzone
  * added TopologyDict and TopologyGroup classes for bond analysis
  * added calc_bonds, calc_angles and calc_torsions cython functions to
    core.distances for quickly calculating bond information
  * added applyPBC(coords, box) function to core.distances to move
    coordinates to within the primary unit cell
  * many AtomGroup methods now support 'pbc' flag to move atoms to within
    primary unitcell before calculation.  This behaviour can also be
    toggled using the core.flags['use_pbc'] flag (Issue 156)
  * MDAnalysis.analysis.rms.rmsd(): new center keyword so that one can
    immediately calculate the minimum rmsd of two rigid-body superimposed
    structures

  Changes

  * libxdrfile2 is now used instead of libxdrfile. libxdrfile2 is distributed
    under GPLv2
  * dropped support for Python 2.5; minimum requirement is Python 2.6
    (Issue 130)
  * almost all methods of AtomGroup return NumPy arrays
  * slicing and indexing of AtomGroup, Residue, ResidueGroup, Segment,
    SegmentGroup will now always return an appropriate object and
    never a simple list
  * removed Timeseries.principleAxis (probably was never working)
  * dependent on Biopython >= 1.59 (Issue 147)
  * Hydrogen bond analysis defaults to updating selection 1 and 2 for
    every timestep in order to avoid unexpected behavior (Issue 138)
  * AtomGroup.velocities is now a (managed) attribute and not a method
    anymore: replace 'ag.velocities()' with 'ag.velocities'
  * changed the name of the flag 'convert_gromacs_lengths' to 'convert_lengths'

  Fixes

  * asUniverse now also accepts any instance that inherits from
    MDAnalysis.Universe (Issue 176)
  * fixed XDR writer incorrect use of delta parameter (Issue 154)
  * fixed incorrect computation of distances in serial and parallel
    distance_array() with PBC (Issue 151)

  * fixed array comparison bug in MDAnalysis.analysis.helanal
    and various enhancements to the helanal module
  * fixed MDAnalysis.analysis.rms.RMSD.run(): gave incorrect results
    if ref_frame != 0
  * alignto() now checks that the two selections describe the same
    atoms (fixes Issue 143)
  * slicing of ResidueGroup will now produce a ResidueGroup, and
    slicing of a SegmentGroup will produce a SegmentGroup, not a list
    as before (fixes Issue 135)
  * detect OpenMP-capable compiler during setup (Issue 145), which should allow
    users of Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8 to build MDAnalysis using Apple's
    C-compiler (clang) (Issue 142) although they will not get a parallel
    version of distance_array.
  * PDB with blank lines gave IndexError (Issue 158)
  * fixed AtomGroup.ts Timestep instance not containing all available
    information (Issue 163)
  * fixed Timestep copy method returning a base Timestep rather than
    appropriate format (Issue 164)

12/24/12 danny.parton, jandom, orbeckst, jjlights03, jphillips, naveen.michaudagrawal, andy.somogyi, sebastien.buchoux

  * 0.7.7

  Enhancements

  * multithreaded distance_array() (Issue 80, experimental); see the
    new core.parallel.distance module
  * MDAnalysis.analysis.rms for simple RMSD analysis
  * format of input coordinates can be set as (filename, format)
    tuples (Issue 76)
  * new AtomGroup.asphericity() and AtomGroup.shapeParameter()
    methods to compute shape descriptors.
  * access to forces (AtomGroup.forces with get_forces() and set_forces();
    the default unit for force is kJ/(mol*A) and it is automatically
    converted from/to native). Currently, only the TRR Reader/Writer
    support forces.
  * all element masses
  * logger reports current version when starting

  Fixes

  * fixed Issue 115 (GROReader now uses fixed-column width format to read GRO files)
  * fixed Issue 116 (Failed to write AMBER netcdf trajectory from AtomGroup)
  * fixed Issue 117 (could not write Gromacs XTC/TRR from AMBER netcdf)
  * fixed Issue 120 (DCDWriter: wrote wrong unitcell information)
  * fixed Issue 121 (PSFParser would fail with IndexError for files without SEGID)
  * Issue 122 (made installation of netCDF4 library optional, which
    means that users of the AMBER netcdf Reader/Writer will have to
    manually install the library and its dependencies netcdf and HDF5,
    see https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/netcdf)

06/30/12 orbeckst, joshua.adelman, andy.somogyi, tyler.je.reddy, lukas.grossar, denniej0, danny.parton

  * 0.7.6

  Enhancements

  * GRO file velocities may be accessed as AtomGroup.velocities()
    or Atom.velocity (Issue 102)
  * PrimitivePDBReader can be sliced
  * AMBER NetCDF (binary trajectory) reader and writer, supporting
    coordinates and velocities; requires netcdf4-python (Issue 109)
  * additional attributes and methods for AtomGroup to consolidate
    the interface to the Timestep: attribute 'positions' and
    'get_positions()' can be used instead of the 'coordinates()'
    method. get/set methods for both positions and velocities.
  * almost all Readers now support some form of slicing; unsupported
    slicing operations will raise a TypeError
  * additional analysis for Nucleic Acid order parameters
    (MDAnalysis.analysis.nuclinfo)
  * AMBER TOPParser now able to do both amber10 and amber12 formats
    (Issue 100)

  Changes

  * selectAtoms: updated *nucleic* and *nucleicxstal* selection definition
    *nucleic* includes the two-letter NA code that follows gromacs topolgy
    format and *nucleicxstal* allows for the one-letter NA code that follows
    the PDB Database code.
  * HydrogenBondAnalysis: multiple enhancements and changes (Issue 103)
    - many new analysis functions (see docs)
    - run() does not return the results anymore; results are simply
      stored as attribute timeseries (similar to other analysis tools)
    - only write per-frame debugging messages to the logfile when the
      new verbose keyword is set to True
    - more reliable detection of hydrogens bonded to heavy atoms
    - remove duplicate hydrogen bonds from the output
  * removed CHO and EAM (formyl and ethanol termini of gA in CHARMM)
    from the set of residues recognized as protein (collision with
    commonly used CHO for cholesterol)
  * PrimitivePDBWriter: special segid SYSTEM is translated to empty
    chainID
  * In order to write multi frame PDB files, the multiframe=True
    keyword must be supplied or use the MultiPDBWriter
  * empty AtomGroup can be constructed or can result from a selection
    without matches; it does *not* raise NoDataError anymore (Issue 12)
  * all single frame readers denote the first (and only) frame as
    frame number 1 (i.e. ts.frame == 1); it used to be 0 but 1 is
    consistent with the way this is is handled with real trajectories
  * requires Biopython >= 1.51 (fixes for Issue 112 and Issue 113)
  * Atom.type is always stored as a string.

  Fixes

  * HydrogenBondAnalysis: NH1 and NH2 were not recognized
  * GROWriter: enforce maximum resname and atomname length of 5 chars
  * Universe.load_new() raised a NameError (thanks to JiyongPark.77)
  * fixed Issue 105 (trajectory snapshots could not be written to PDB)
  * fixed Issue 107 (NAMD/VMD space delimited PSF files can be
    autodetected and read); important when using CGENFF atom types
    (thanks to JiyongPark.77 for initial patch)
  * fixed Issue 101 (could not write single frame to trr file)
  * fixed: permissive=True flag was ignored in Universe and hence the
    PrimitivePDBReader was always selected even if the Biopython one
    was desired
  * fixed Issue 112 (used removed Biopython constructs in
    MDAnalysis.analysis.align.fasta2select; thanks to francesco.oteri
    for a test case and fix)
  * fixed failing 'type' selection for topology formats that read an
    atom type as an integer (such as the AMBER parser)
  * fixed Issue 111 (NAN in pycpqrot and RMSD calculation)
  * fixed Issue 113 (replaced outdated Biopython to call ClustalW)


02/16/12 sebastien.buchoux

  * 0.7.5.1

  Fixes

  * added: missing files (Issue 95)
  * removed: unused delaunay-related files

02/11/12 orbeckst, sebastien.buchoux, jandom, hallben, lukasgrossar

  * 0.7.5

  MDAnalysis can now be found on PyPI, allowing simple installation
  from the internet. Metadata was added to setup to facilitate PyPI
  upload and pages on the wiki describe how to do this.
  In addition, Debian/Ubuntu packages are also available.

  Note that in order to run UnitTests one needs the separate package
  MDAnalysisTests (also release 0.7.5).

  Enhancements

  * new method OtherWriter() for trajectory readers to generate a
    writer for any format that has been initialised for the common
    basic values
  * new simple Residue.chi1_selection() selection
  * new distances.between() function (EXPERIMENTAL)
  * support LAMMPS non-standard DCD files (Issue 84; EXPERIMENTAL)
  * read and write multi-frame PDB files (Issue 77; EXPERIMENTAL)
  * extend the PDB parsing, support CONECT and REMARK entries
  * new GNM-based trajectory analysis module (Issue 90)
  * Read/Write velocities with TRR, new attribute Atom.velocity
    and AtomGroup.velocities() (Issue 91)
  * hydrogen bond analysis detects a range of GLYCAM atom types
    and utils.convert_aa_code will also accept GLYCAM-style residue
    names (Issue 92)
  * XYZ reader: can set timestep (Issue 92)

  Changes

  * The UnitTests are now integrated with the separate test data in a
    separate Python package named MDAnalysisTests; to run the tests
    for 0.7.5 one will need MDAnalysisTests-0.7.5 (Issue 87).
  * install a range of analysis dependencies right away: networkx,
    biopython, GridDataFormats (usually all painless); leave scipy and
    matplotlib to the user and the local package manager
  * When writing a trajectory and converting units, effectively a copy
    of the timestep is made and the in-memory timestep is not
    altered. In this way, analysis after writing a frame will still
    see the coordinates in MDAnalysis units and not converted units.

  Fixes

  * analysis.align.rms_fit_traj(): can output fitted trajectory to any
    supported format not just the input format
  * fixed ProgressMeter: default format string was broken
  * fixed: ResidueGroup and SegmentGroup indexing (did not work with
    numpy.int64 etc) and now raise TypeError if it does not fit
  * fixed HydrogenBondingAnalysis backbone donor list: had C but
    should have been O (this was supposed to be fixed with r849 in
    0.7.4 but a typo crept in). NOTE: analysis might have produced
    partially wrong results.
  * fixed: dihedral() and other methods using core.util.angle() sometimes
    returned nan instead of +pi or -pi
  * fixed: writing a trajectory from chained CRD files gave garbage
    coordinates (Issue 81)
  * fixed: support files for docs are now in included in the source
    distribution (thanks to Sebastien Buchoux; Issue 82)
  * fixed: core.util.iterable() would wrongly detect unicode strings
    as "iterable"; this lead the Reader autodections and then the
    ChainReader fail with "Runtime Error: Maximum recursion depth
    exceeded" for single filenames provided as a unicode string.
  * fixed: HBond analysis pickling of tables (Issue 92)


07/09/11 orbeckst, dcaplan, jandom

  * 0.7.4

  Enhancements

  * Universe() got new keywords topology_format and format to allow
    the user to specify the file formats instead of deriving it from the
    extensions (does not work with "chained" files at the moment); thanks to
    Michael Lerner for the suggestion
  * Chain trajectory reader allows frame indexing.
  * Issue 75: additional donors and acceptors keywords for H-bond analysis
  * structural alignment functions alignto() and rms_fit_traj() can also take a
    list of selection strings in order to define atom groups with fixed atom
    order and alignto() preserves the order of supplied AtomGroups for the
    special select values "all" and None.
  * new set_* methods for AtomGroup allows changing of Atom attributes
    for all members of the group (such as the segid) (EXPERIMENTAL)
  * new Atom and Residue attribute resnum that can be used to store
    the canonical PDB residue number (EXPERIMENTAL)

  Fixes

  * fixed Issue 74 (bug in AMBER topology parser which would show up for
    certain numbers of input lines; thanks to htaoyu1)
  * fix for Issue 48 (sparse contact_matrix in distances.py was slow when
    written in pure python; optimized in c code using scipy.weave)
  * HydrogenBondingAnalysis: donor atom name CO --> O (proper backbone
    oxygen); without the fix one misses most of the backbone H-bonds
  * alignto() and rms_fit_trj(): order of mobile and reference
    selection was reversed when supplied as a tuple (sel1, sel2)

  Changes

  * replaced analysis.util.progress_meter() with class core.log.ProgressMeter

  * Issue 28: split off test data trajectories and structures from
    MDAnalaysis/tests/data into separate package MDAnalysisTestData, which is
    required to run the UnitTests from release 0.7.4 onwards. Numbering matches
    the earliest MDAnalysis release for which the data is needed. Any later
    releases of MDAnalysis will also use these test data unless a
    MDAnalysisTestData package with a higher release number is available.



05/22/11 orbeckst, jandom, Benjamin Hall, Paul Rigor, dcaplan,
         Christian Beckstein (logo), denniej0

  * 0.7.3

  Removals

  * completely removed the old core.rms_fitting module (and thus we also do not
    depend on the LAPACK library anymore, which should simplify installation);
    use the functions accessible through MDAnalysis.analysis.align (which are
    faster and use QCPROT)

  Enhancements

  * PDBQT (autodock) format added (reading and writing of single frames)
  * new attributes universe.trajectory.frame and universe.trajectory.frame:
    report the current frame number and time (e.g. in ps) of the current frame
    of the trajectory
  * new attribute Timestep.volume (unit cell volume)
  * new special methods of AtomGroup: bond(), angle(), improper() in
    addition to the calculation of dihedral()
  * HELANAL helix analysis in MDAnalysis.analysis.helanal; Python
    implementation of helanal.f from
    http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/users/kumarsan/HELANAL/helanal.html (Benjamin
    Hall, used under GPL v2+)
  * hydrogen bonds analysis in MDAnalysis.analysis.hbonds
  * MDAnalysis.analysis.distances.dist() for calculating distances between
    matching atoms in two groups
  * MDAnalysis logo by Christian Beckstein (and a reformatting of the
    online docs to match the logo theme)

  Change of behaviour

  * alignto() and rms_fit_trj(): changed keyword 'select' default from
    'backbone' to 'all'

  Fixes

  * fixed alignto() (raised KeyError)
  * fixed Issue 57 (check for illegal coordinates when writing PDB and GRO)
  * use spaces everywhere and no TABs and tell emacs and vim to keep it that
    way (Issue 69)
  * fixed Issue 70 (problems with instant atom selections)


03/31/11 orbeckst, dcaplan, naveen.michaudagrawal
  * 0.7.2
  * NOTE: minimum Python version required is 2.5 (since 0.6.3)

  Enhancements

  * loading from a PDB sets segid to the chain id if it exists
  * PrimitivePDBWriter uses first letter of segid as PDB chain id
  * aliased segment.name to segment.id
  * new method AtomGroup.bbox() that returns the orthorhombic bounding box
  * enhancements of the analysis.density module (build density
    from B-factors)
  * PQR radius is now an attribute of Atom; AtomGroup.radii() returns the
    radii as a NumPy array; internally B-factor has also become an
    attribute of each Atom.
  * recognise many more OPLS/AA and Amber residue names as "protein"
  * recognise more atom masses (taken from CHARMM27 and Gromacs) and
    atom types (from CHARMM, Amber, OPLS, GROMOS) and moved
    masses and types into new module topology.tables; the type recognition
    is still incomplete but can be easily enhanced in tables
  * analysis.align: convenience functions rotation_matrix() and alignto()
  * TrajectoryReader gained Writer() method which returns an appropriate
    TrajectoryWriter instance that can be used for processing this
    trajectory (enhancement of the Trajectory API); if no Writer is known
    then a NotImplementedError is raised
  * doc improvements

  Fixes

  * installation: removed dependency on Cython; developer should
    use setup_developer.py instead of setup.py (Issue 66)
  * Fixed a problem with the strict PDBReader: raised exception when the
    pdb did not contain a segid
  * Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when
    writing (Issue 63) --- makes the (default) PrimitivePDBReader/Writer
    more suitable for NAMD/CHARMM but breaks strict PDB standard. If
    you need full PDB reading capabilities, use the strict PDB reader
    [i.e. use Universe(..., permissive=False)]
  * fixed bug in (experimental) phi and psi selections
  * fixed bugs in reading of unit cells (Issue 60, Issue 61, Issue 34)
  * universe.trajectory.delta returns the full precision dt value
    instead of a value rounded to 4 decimals (Issue 64)
  * fixed bug in DCDWriter (XTC->DCD was broken, Issue 59)

02/08/11 orbeckst, denniej0, jandom, tyler.je.reddy, Joshua Adelman
  * 0.7.1 release
  * online documentation
  * AMBER topology and trj capabilities (netcdf not yet available)
  * PQR file reading support
  * new analysis.contacts.ContactAnalysis1 class that supports a
    native contact analysis between arbitrary groups
  * new examples (e.g. peptide helix clustering in a membrane)
  * fixed Issue 58 (align.rms_fit_trj; fix reported by Joshua Adelman)
  * new analysis module 'density': creation and analysis of volume data
  * fast RMSD aligner based on Douglas Theobald's QCP method for
    calculating the minimum RMSD between two structures and
    determining the optimal least-squares rotation matrix;
    replaces the slower previous code (implemented by Joshua Adelman from
    his pyqcprot package https://github.com/synapticarbors/pyqcprot);
    deprecated core.rms_fitting.rms_rotation_matrix() and scheduled for
    removal in 0.8
  * uses cython instead of pyrex

11/05/10 orbeckst, denniej0, tyler.je.reddy, danny.parton, joseph.goose
  * major release 0.7.0
    (includes changes that can BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY)
  * Removed ALL DEPRECATED code:
    - AtomGroup.principleAxes (Issue 33)
    - DCD.DCDReader.dcd_header() and DCD.DCDWriter.dcd_header()
      (use _dcd_header())
    - Universe.dcd (and Universe.xtc, Universe.trr...) --- from
      now on only Universe.trajectory is supported.
      WILL BREAK LEGACY CODE!
    - removed the following packages from top-level MDAnalysis
      name space:
          - AtomGroup, Selection: import them from MDAnalysis.core if
            really needed (e.g. 'import MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup')
          - distances, rms_fitting: 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.distances'
            or 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rms_fitting' (the
            actual modules still live in MDAnalysis.core but they
            might get moved in the future and bundled with
            transformations)
          - 'from MDAnalysis import *' will only get ['Timeseries',
            'Universe', 'asUniverse', 'Writer', 'collection']
          - removed copy flag from distance_array and self_distance_array:
            setting it to False would always give wrong results so there was
            no good reason keeping it around
  * whitespace is no longer required around parentheses for
    selectAtoms strings but the old syntax with white space
    still works (Issue 43)
  * improved trajectory writing
    - MDAnalysis.Writer() factory function that provides an
      appropriate writer for the desired file format
    - Writer.write() accepts a Timestep, a Universe, or a
      arbitrary AtomGroup (e.g. from a selection); this is much
      more flexible than Writer.write_next_timestep()
  * New attributes for trajectory readers: dt (time between
    frames) and totaltime (length of the trajectory)
  * Changes to AtomGroup
    - Indexing is made consistent with the way lists behave:
       1. indexing with integers returns a single Atom
       2. slicing always returns a new AtomGroup
       3. advanced slicing with a list or array returns a new
          AtomGroup (NEW, fixes Issue 36)
    - AtomGroup coordinates can be manipulated (translate(),
      rotate() and rotateby() methods; when appropriate, these methods
      can take AtomGroups or arrays to determine coordinates)
    - new attributes 'residues' and 'segments' for AtomGroup to give
      access to the list of residue/segment objects of the group
    - new exception 'NoDataError'; raised when creation of an empty
      AtomGroup is attempted (see also Issue 12)
    - consistent representation of the Segment > Residue > Atom
      hierarchy: all classes related to AtomGroup have the
      attributes 'atoms', 'residues', 'segments' which provide
      access to groups of the corresponding objects
  * improvements to Residue, ResidueGroup and Segment classes
    - documented accessing residues from Segment as
      Segment.r<resid>; resid is 1-based -- BREAKS OLD CODE
      that relied on this being 0-based
    - added SegmentGroup class
          - can write from Residue, ResidueGroup and Segment (Issue 46)
          - residue name attribute of a Segment now consistently
            returns a ResidueGroup (Issue 47) -- MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE
          - added documentation and examples in the doc strings
          - new special dihedral angle selections defined for Residue
            class to simplify analysis of backbone torsions (experimental)
  * new contact_matrix method for calculating contacts
    (Issue 30); for large (N > ~10000) coordinate arrays
    automatically switches to a method using a sparse matrix (slower)
  * more example scripts (e.g. for membrane analysis, trajectory writing,
    coordinate transformations)
  * CRDReader added (fixes  Issue 40 ) ... it will work for both
    standard and extended formats: NO special flags needed.
  * CRDWriter will now write extended crd files: NO special flags needed.
  * By default, PDB files are read with the PrimitivePDBReader and not
    the Bio.PDB reader anymore because the latter can drop atoms when
    they have the same name in a residue (which happens for systems
    generated from MD simulations) The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine
    with those cases (but does not handle esoteric PDB features such as
    alternative atoms and insertion codes that are not needed for
    handling MD simulation data).
      - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis  can be set through the flag
        MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader']. The default is True.
      - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the
        permissive keyword to Universe; e.g. Universe(...,permissive=False)
        will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be
        useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.
  * fixed Issue 51 (distance_array() did not properly check its
    input and wrong results could be returned if the input was a
    float64 and a float32 array)

09/19/10 orbeckst
  * quick-fix release 0.6.4.1
  * fixed import issue with python 2.5 (Issue 41)

09/16/10 orbeckst, danny.parton
  * release 0.6.4
  * GRO writer added
  * fixed XTC writer (Issue 38)
  * convert box representations (Issue 37)
  * primitive PDB parser added (slightly faster and ignores
    correctness of resids, atomnames etc but reads CRYST1 into unitcell)
  * Universe gained the 'permissive' flag to switch on the
    primitive PDB parser/reader
  * Simple 'chained reader' which enables a Universe to
    transparently read a list of trajectory files (Issue 39).
  * Additional methods for AtomGroup: numberOfResidues(), resids(), resnames()
  * new bilayer analysis script for membrane composition on a
    per-leaflet basis (examples/membrane-composition.py); also
    renamed examples/leaflet.py to membrane-leaflets.py

07/08/10 orbeckst, denniej0, danny.parton, philipwfowler
  * 0.6.3 release
  * minimum requirement is python 2.4 (using with_statement in the
    analysis module and we have not tested on 2.3 in a while)
  * analysis modules (MDAnalysis.analysis):
     - lipid bilayer leaflet detection
     - native contact analysis ("q1-q2")
     - rms-fitting based on sequence alignment
  * write selections for other codes from AtomGroups (VMD, pymol, CHARMM,
    Gromacs ndx)
  * gro reader (Issue 31)
  * better API for loading a topology and a coordinate file in Universe()
  * trajectory reader: DCDReader can reverse trajectory with negative
    step increment; XTC/TRRReader can do simple (forward) slices by doing
    (slow!) sequential iteration
  * deprecated principleAxes() and introduced principalAxes() with less
    confusing return values (Issue 33).
  * fixed wrong unitcell dimensions for XTC/TRR (Issue 34)
  * added basic XYZ reader with compression support (Issue 35)
  * PDB reader guesses masses (unknown elements are set to 0)
  * installation requires Biopython (www.biopython.org)

05/28/10 orbeckst, denniej0
  * 0.6.2 release
  * removed a number of imports from the top level (such as rms_fitting);
    this might break some scripts that still rely on the layout that was
    used for 0.5.x (which is now officially declared deprecated)
  * defined trajectory API
  * deprecated DCD.dcd_header --> DCD._dcd_header
  * XTC and TRR compute numframes by iterating through trajectory (slow!)
  * introduced units: base units are ps (time) and Angstrom (length); see core.flags
  * XTC and TRR automatically convert between native Gromacs units (ps, nm) and
    base units (uses core.flags['convert_gromacs_lengths'] = True)
  * more test cases
  * *really* FIXED Issue 16 (can easy_install from tar file)
  * FIXED a bug in AtomGroup.principalAxes()
  * added dependency information to setup.py (numpy and
    biopython by default; nose for tests)

04/30/10 orbeckst

  * 0.6.1 release
  * can build a simple Universe from a PDB file (FIXES Issue 11)
  * can read Gromacs XTC and TRR files (FIXES Issue 1) but no
    Timeseries or Collections yet for those formats

    --- use the generic Universe.load_new() (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
  * removed deprecated Universe._dcd attribute (MIGHT BREAK OLD CODE)
  * FIXED bug in PDB.PDBWriter and CRD.CRDWriter
  * use SloppyPDB in order to cope with large PDB files
  * core.distances.self_distance_array() is now behaving the
    same way as distance_array()
