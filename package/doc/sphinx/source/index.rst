:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

**MDAnalysis** (`www.mdanalysis.org`_) is an object-oriented python
toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by
CHARMM_, Gromacs_, Amber_, NAMD_, LAMMPS_, `DL_POLY`_ and other
packages; it also reads other formats (e.g., PDB_ files and `XYZ
format`_ trajectories; see :ref:`Supported coordinate formats` and
:ref:`Supported topology formats` for the full lists). It can write
most of these formats, too, together with atom selections for use in
Gromacs_, CHARMM_, VMD_ and PyMol_ (see :ref:`Selection exporters`).

It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the
atomic coordinates through NumPy_ arrays. This provides a flexible and
relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Fairly complete
atom :ref:`selection-commands-label` are implemented. Trajectories can
also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and
written out in a range of formats.

User Guide
==========

The MDAnalysis `User Guide`_ provides comprehensive information on how to
use the library. We would recommend that new users have a look at the
`Quick Start Guide`_. The User Guide also has a set of `examples`_ on how to
use the MDAnalysis library which may be of interest.

.. _installation-instructions:

Installing MDAnalysis
=====================

The easiest approach to `install the latest release`_ is to use a package that
can be installed either with conda_ or pip_.

conda
-----

First installation with conda_:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install mdanalysis

which will automatically install a *full set of dependencies*.

To upgrade later:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda update mdanalysis

pip
---

Installation with `pip`_ and a *minimal set of dependencies*:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis

To install with a *full set of dependencies* (which includes everything needed
for :mod:`MDAnalysis.analysis`), add the ``[analysis]`` tag:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis[analysis]


Tests
-----

If you want to `run the tests`_ or use example files to follow some of the
examples in the documentation or the tutorials_, also install the
``MDAnalysisTests`` package:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install mdanalysistests            # with conda
   pip install --upgrade MDAnalysisTests    # with pip

.. _install the latest release:
   https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/installation.html#installation
.. _pip:
   http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html
.. _conda:
   http://conda.pydata.org/docs/
.. _run the tests: https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/UnitTests
.. _tutorials: https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/
