Visualization modules
*********************

The MDAnalysis.visualization namespace contains code to carry out analyses
which return data that is specifically-tailored for visualization.

Please see the individual module documentation for additional references and
citation information.

These modules are not imported by default; in order to use them one has to
import them from :mod:`MDAnalysis.visualization`, for instance: ::

    import MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines

.. Note:: 

  Some of the modules require additional Python packages such as numpy_ or matplotlib_.
