Coordinates modules
**************************

The coordinates module contains the classes to read and write
trajectories. Typically, MDAnalysis recognizes :ref:`Supported coordinate
formats` by the file extension and hence most users probably do not need to
concern themselves with classes and functions described here. However,
if MDAnalysis fails to recognize a coordinate file then the user can
provide the format in the keyword argument *format* to
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` to force the format.

functionality should first read the :ref:`Trajectory API`.
