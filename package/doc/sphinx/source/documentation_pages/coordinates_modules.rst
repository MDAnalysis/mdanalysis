Coordinates modules
**************************

The coordinates module contains the classes to read and write
trajectories. Typically, MDAnalysis recognizes :ref:`Supported coordinate
formats` by the file extension and hence most users probably do not need to
concern themselves with classes and functions described here. However,
if MDAnalysis fails to recognize a coordinate file then the user can
provide the format in the keyword argument *format* to
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` to force the format.

The remaining pages are primarily of interest to
developers. Programmers and anyone trying to implement new
functionality should first read the :ref:`Trajectory API`.

In particular, all trajectory readers have to be 
:ref:`serializable<serialization>` and they should pass all tests
available in the ``MDAnalysisTests.coordinates.base.MultiframeReaderTest`` 
or ``MDAnalysisTests.coordinates.base.BaseReaderTest``.
