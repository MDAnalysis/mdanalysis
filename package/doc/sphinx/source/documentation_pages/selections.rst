 Selection commands
====================

Once you have the :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` object, you can
select atoms (using a syntax very similar to `CHARMM's atom selection
syntax`_)::

  >>> kalp = universe.select_atoms("segid KALP")

.. _`CHARMM's atom selection syntax`: 
   http://www.charmm.org/documentation/c37b1/select.html

The :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` method of a
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` or a
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` returns a
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`, so you can use all the methods
defined for AtomGroups on them. Selections always return an
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` with atoms sorted according to their
index in the topology (this is to ensure that there are not any duplicates,
which can happen with complicated selections).

One can group subselections using parentheses::

 >>> universe.select_atoms("segid DMPC and not (name H* or name O*)")
 <AtomGroup with 3420 atoms>

Almost all the basic CHARMM selections work.

It is also possible to export selections for external software
packages with the help of :ref:`Selection exporters`.


Selection Keywords
==================

The following describes all selection keywords currently understood by the
selection parser. The following applies to all selections:

* Keywords are case sensitive.
* Atoms are automatically sequentially ordered in a resulting selection (see
  notes below on :ref:`ordered-selections-label` for how to circumvent this if
  necessary).
* Selections are parsed left to right and parentheses can be used for
  grouping.
* Currently, only "stemming" is implemented as a primitive form of pattern
  matching: Using the ``*`` character in a string such as ``GL*`` selects
  all strings that start with "GL" such as "GLU", "GLY", "GLX29", "GLN".


Simple selections
-----------------

protein, backbone, nucleic, nucleicbackbone
    selects all atoms that belong to a standard set of residues; a protein
    is identfied by a hard-coded set of residue names so it  may not
    work for esoteric residues.

segid *seg-name*
    select by segid (as given in the topology), e.g. ``segid 4AKE`` or
    ``segid DMPC`` 

resid *residue-number-range*
    resid can take a single residue number or a range of numbers. A range
    consists of two numbers separated by a colon (inclusive) such
    as ``resid 1:5``. A residue number ("resid") is taken directly from the
    topology.

resnum *resnum-number-range*
    resnum is the canonical residue number; typically it is set to the
    residue id in the original PDB structure.

resname *residue-name*
    select by residue name, e.g. ``resname LYS``

name *atom-name*
    select by atom name (as given in the topology). Often, this is force
    field dependent. Example: ``name CA`` (for C&alpha; atoms) or ``name
    OW`` (for SPC water oxygen) 

type *atom-type*
    select by atom type; this is either a string or a number and depends on
    the force field; it is read from the topology file (e.g. the CHARMM PSF
    file contains numeric atom types). It has non-sensical values when a
    PDB or GRO file is used as a topology. 

atom *seg-name*  *residue-number*  *atom-name*
    a selector for a single atom consisting of segid resid atomname,
    e.g. ``DMPC 1 C2`` selects the C2 carbon of the first residue of the
    DMPC segment  

Boolean
-------

not
    all atoms not in the selection, e.g. ``not protein`` selects all atoms
    that aren't part of a protein 

and, or
    combine two selections according to the rules of boolean algebra,
    e.g. ``protein and not (resname ALA or resname LYS)`` selects all atoms
    that belong to a protein, but are not in a lysine or alanine residue  

Geometric
---------

around *distance*  *selection*
    selects all atoms a certain cutoff away from another selection,
    e.g. ``around 3.5 protein`` selects all atoms not belonging to protein
    that are within 3.5 Angstroms from the protein

sphlayer *innerRadius* *externalRadius* *selection*
    selects all atoms within a spherical layer centered in the center of
    geometry (COG) of a given selection, e.g., ``sphlayer 2.4 6.0 ( protein
    and ( resid 130 or resid 80 ) )`` selects the center of geometry of
    protein, resid 130, resid 80 and creates a spherical layer of inner
    radius 2.4 and external radius 6.0 around the COG.

sphzone *externalRadius* *selection*
    selects all atoms within a spherical zone centered in the center of
    geometry (COG) of a given selection, e.g. ``sphzone 6.0 ( protein and (
    resid 130 or resid 80 ) )`` selects the center of geometry of protein,
    resid 130, resid 80 and creates a sphere of radius 6.0 around the COG.	

cylayer *innerRadius* *externalRadius* *zMax* *zMin* *selection*
    selects all atoms within a cylindric layer centered in the center of
    geometry (COG) of a given selection, e.g. ``cylayer 5 10 10 -8
    protein`` selects the center of geometry of protein, and creates a
    cylindrical layer of inner radius 5, external radius 10 centered on the
    COG. In z, the cylinder extends from 10 above the COG to 8
    below. Positive values for *zMin*, or negative ones for *zMax*, are
    allowed.	

cyzone *externalRadius* *zMax* *zMin* *selection*    
    selects all atoms within a cylindric zone centered in the center of
    geometry (COG) of a given selection, e.g. ``cyzone 15 4 -8 protein and
    resid 42`` selects the center of geometry of protein and resid 42, and
    creates a cylinder of external radius 15 centered on the COG. In z, the
    cylinder extends from 4 above the COG to 8 below. Positive values for
    *zMin*, or negative ones for *zMax*, are allowed.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.10.0    
       keywords *cyzone* and *cylayer* now take *zMax* and *zMin* to be
       relative to the COG of *selection*, instead of absolute z-values
       in the box. 

point *x* *y* *z*  *distance*   
    selects all atoms within a cutoff of a point in space, make sure
    coordinate is separated by spaces, e.g. ``point 5.0 5.0 5.0 3.5``
    selects all atoms within 3.5 Angstroms of the coordinate (5.0, 5.0,
    5.0)

prop [abs] *property*  *operator*  *value*    
    selects atoms based on position, using *property* **x**, **y**, or
    **z** coordinate. Supports the **abs** keyword (for absolute value) and
    the following *operators*: **<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=**. For example,
    ``prop z >= 5.0`` selects all atoms with z coordinate greater than 5.0;
    ``prop abs z <= 5.0`` selects all atoms within -5.0 <= z <= 5.0.

From version 0.6 onwards, some geometric selections (around, sphlayer,
sphzone, point) can use a k-d tree based, fast search algorithm (about three
times faster than the previous version). However, it does not take periodicity
into account. The fast algorithm is the default for *around*. Periodicity is
only taken into account with the
:func:`~MDAnalysis.lib.distances.distance_array` functions via a minimum
image convention (and this only works for rectangular simulation cells). If
periodic boundary conditions should be taken into account then change the
default behaviour of MDAnalysis by setting these two flags::

  MDAnalysis.core.flags['use_periodic_selections'] = True
  MDAnalysis.core.flags['use_KDTree_routines'] = False


Similarity and connectivity
---------------------------

same *subkeyword* as *selection*
    selects all atoms that have the same *subkeyword* value as any atom in
    *selection*. Allowed *subkeyword* values are the atom properties: ``name,
    type, resname, resid, segid, mass, charge, radius, bfactor, resnum``, the
    groups an atom belong to: ``residue, segment, fragment``, and the atom
    coordinates ``x, y, z``.

byres *selection*
    selects all atoms that are in the same segment and residue as selection,
    e.g. specify the subselection after the byres keyword.  ``byres`` is a
    shortcut to ``same residue as``

Index
-----

bynum *index-range*
    selects all atoms within a range of (1-based) inclusive indices,
    e.g. ``bynum 1`` selects the first atom in the universe; ``bynum 5:10``
    selects atoms 5 through 10 inclusive. All atoms in the
    :class:`MDAnalysis.Universe` are consecutively numbered, and the index
    runs from 1 up to the total number of atoms.

.. _pre-selections-label:

Preexisting selections and modifiers
------------------------------------

group `group-name`
    selects the atoms in the :class:`AtomGroup` passed to the function as an
    argument named `group-name`. Only the atoms common to `group-name` and the
    instance :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` was called
    from will be considered, unless ``group`` is preceded by the ``global``
    keyword. `group-name` will be included in the parsing just by comparison of
    atom indices. This means that it is up to the user to make sure the
    `group-name` group was defined in an appropriate :class:`Universe`.

global *selection*
    by default, when issuing
    :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` from an
    :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`, selections and subselections
    are returned intersected with the atoms of that instance.  Prefixing a
    selection term with ``global`` causes its selection to be returned in its
    entirety.  As an example, the ``global`` keyword allows for
    ``lipids.select_atoms("around 10 global protein")`` --- where ``lipids`` is
    a group that does not contain any proteins. Were ``global`` absent, the
    result would be an empty selection since the ``protein`` subselection would
    itself be empty.  When issuing
    :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` from a
    :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`, ``global`` is ignored. 

.. deprecated:: 0.11
   The use of ``fullgroup`` has been deprecated in favor of the equivalent
   ``global group``.

Dynamic selections
==================

By default :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` returns an
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`, in which the list of atoms is
constant across trajectory frame changes. If
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` is invoked with named
argument ``updating`` set to ``True``, an
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.UpdatingAtomGroup` instance will be returned
instead. It behaves just like an :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
object, with the difference that the selection expressions are re-evaluated
every time the trajectory frame changes (this happens lazily, only when the
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.UpdatingAtomGroup` object is accessed so that
there is no redundant updating going on)::

 # A dynamic selection of corner atoms:
 >>> ag_updating = universe.select_atoms("prop x < 5 and prop y < 5 and prop z < 5", updating=True)
 >>> ag_updating
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 9 atoms>
 >>> universe.trajectory.next()
 >>> ag_updating
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 14 atoms>

Using the ``group`` selection keyword for
:ref:`preexisting-selections <pre-selections-label>`, one can
make updating selections depend on
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`, or even other
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.UpdatingAtomGroup`, instances.
Likewise, making an updating selection from an already updating group will
cause later updates to also reflect the updating of the base group::

 >>> chained_ag_updating = ag_updating.select_atoms("resid 1:1000", updating=True)
 >>> chained_ag_updating
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 3 atoms>
 >>> universe.trajectory.next()
 >>> chained_ag_updating
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 7 atoms>

Finally, a non-updating selection or a slicing/addition operation made on an
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.UpdatingAtomGroup` will return a static
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`, which will no longer update
across frames::

 >>> static_ag = ag_updating.select_atoms("resid 1:1000")
 >>> static_ag
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 3 atoms>
 >>> universe.trajectory.next()
 >>> static_ag
 <UpdatingAtomGroup with 3 atoms>


Instant selectors
=================

For interactive work it becomes rather tedious to type common selection strings
repeatedly. MDAnalysis automatically generates a number of *instant selectors*
as attributes of the :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` and number of
other levels of the structural hierarchy, namely for
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`,
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Residue`,
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.ResidueGroup`,
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Segment` and
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.SegmentGroup`.

Segment selector
----------------

- ``universe.<segid>`` or ``universe.s<segid>`` (if *<segid>* starts with a
  number)
- returns a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Segment`
- works for :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` and :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.SegmentGroup`
- example
   >>> u.s4AKE
   <Segment '4AKE'>

Resid selector
--------------

- ``seg.r<N>`` selects residue with number ``<N>``
- returns a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Residue`
- works for :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Segment` and :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.SegmentGroup`
- example
    >>>  u.s4AKE.r100
    <Residue 'GLY', 100>
 
Residue name selector
---------------------

- ``seg.<resname>`` selects residues with residue name ``<resname>``
- returns a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.ResidueGroup`
- works for :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Segment` and :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.SegmentGroup`
- examples
    >>> u.s4AKE.MET
    <ResidueGroup [<Residue 'MET', 1>, <Residue 'MET', 21>, <Residue 'MET', 34>, <Residue 'MET', 53>, <Residue 'MET', 96>, <Residue 'MET', 174>]>
    >>> u.s4AKE.CYS
    <ResidueGroup [<Residue 'CYS', 77>]>
    >>> u.s4AKE.TRP
    NoDataError: No atoms defined for AtomGroup
- The result is always a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.ResidueGroup`; if no
  residues can be found then a :exc:`MDAnalysis.NoDataError` is raised.

Atom name selector
------------------

- ``g.<atomname>`` selects a single atom or a group of atoms with name
  ``<atomname>``
- returns 
    - a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom` if only a single atom was found,
    - a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` if more than one atom was
      found, or
    - raises a :exc:`MDAnalysis.SelectionError` if no atom was found.
- works for any group derived from :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
  (i.e. all the ones mentioned above)
- examples
    >>> u.atoms.CG
    >>> <AtomGroup with 125 atoms>
    >>> u.s4AKE.CG     
    <AtomGroup with 125 atoms>
    >>> u.s4AKE.r100.CA
    < Atom 1516: name 'CA' of type '23' of resname 'GLY', resid 100 and segid '4AKE'>
    >>> u.s4AKE.r100.CB
    SelectionError: No atom in residue GLY with name CB
  

.. _ordered-selections-label:

Ordered selections
==================

:meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` sorts the atoms
in the :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` by atom index before
returning them (this is to eliminate possible duplicates in the
selection). If the ordering of atoms is crucial (for instance when
describing angles or dihedrals) or if duplicate atoms are required
then one has to concatenate multiple AtomGroups, which does not sort
them.

The most straightforward way to concatentate two AtomGroups is by using the
``+`` operator::

 >>> ordered = u.select_atoms("segid DMPC and resid 3 and name P") + u.select_atoms("segid DMPC and resid 2 and name P")
 >>> print list(ordered)
 [< Atom 570: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 3 and 'DMPC'>,
 < Atom 452: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 2 and 'DMPC'>]

A shortcut is to provide *two or more* selections to
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe.select_atoms`, which then
does the concatenation automatically::

 >>> print list(universe.select_atoms("segid DMPC and resid 3 and name P", "segid DMPC and resid 2 and name P"))
 [< Atom 570: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 3 and 'DMPC'>,
 < Atom 452: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 2 and 'DMPC'>]

Just for comparison to show that a single selection string does not
work as one might expect::

 # WRONG!
 >>> print list(universe.select_atoms("segid DMPC and ( resid 3 or resid 2 ) and name P"))
 [< Atom 452: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 2 and 'DMPC'>,
 < Atom 570: name 'P' of type '180' of resid 'DMPC', 3 and 'DMPC'>]
