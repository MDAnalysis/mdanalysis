.. module:: MDAnalysis.lib
   :synopsis: ``lib`` collects independent code for re-use in MDAnalysis

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib` contains code that is independent of the
specific MDAnalysis framework, such as fast calculators for distances
or simple logging support. Modules do not depend on other code inside
MDAnalysis except in :mod:`MDAnalysis.lib` itself (and possibly in
:mod:`MDAnalysis.exceptions`) and thus can be easily imported
elsewhere.

Overview
--------

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.distances` contains many high performance maths
functions. Most of them have the keyword *backend* that allows one to
either select serial (single threaded) code (``backend="serial``) or
to use parallelized versions (e.g. ``backend="OpenMP"`` for OpenMP
parallelism).

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.transformations` contains a multitude of
matrix operations for manipulating coordinate data.

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.qcprot` contains a fast implementation of
superposition by minimizing the RMSD.

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.util` contains various file and string utility
functions whereas mathematical functions are to be found in
:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.mdamath`.

:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.NeighborSearch` contains classes to do neighbor
searches with MDAnalysis objects.

Low level file formats
----------------------

The modules in :mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.formats` contain code to access various file
formats in a way that is *independent from other MDAnalysis functionality*
(i.e., they do not use any classes from :mod:`MDAnalysis.core` or
:mod:`MDAnalysis.topology`). This low-level code is used in the
:mod:`MDAnalysis.coordinates` module but can also be re-used by other
Python-based projects.
