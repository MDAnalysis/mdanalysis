Topology modules
**************************

The topology module contains the functions to read topology
files. MDAnalysis uses topology files to identify atoms and bonds
between the atoms. It can use topology files from MD packages such as
CHARMM's and NAMD's PSF format or Amber's PRMTOP files. In addition,
it can also glean atom information from single frame coordinate files
such the PDB, CRD, or PQR formats (see the :ref:`Supported topology
formats`).

Typically, MDAnalysis recognizes formats by the file extension and
hence most users probably do not need to concern themselves with
classes and functions described here. However, if MDAnalysis does not
properly recognize a file format then a user can explicitly set the
topology file format in the *topology_format* keyword argument to
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`.

contain functions and classes that are used in the implementation of
the topology readers.
