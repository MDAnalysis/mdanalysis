Interactive help in Python

Interactive help is available from within the python interpreter
through the standard "python doc strings". Type ::

       help(function)
       help(class)

  to get the online help. For instance, to learn more about MDAnalysis
  and the Universe class::

       import MDAnalysis
       help(MDAnalysis)
       help(MDAnalysis.Universe)

  In ipython you can use the question mark operator ::

       MDAnalysis?
       MDAnalysis.Universe?
       MDAnalysis.Universe??

  (The '??' also shows the source code.)
