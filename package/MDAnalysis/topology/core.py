Common functions for topology building --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.topology.core`

   information that is used by functions such as :func:`guess_atom_type` and
   :func:`guess_atom_mass`.

    """A customised dictionary designed for sorting the bonds, angles and

    Usage::

      topologydict = TopologyDict(members)

    :Arguments:
        *members*
            A list of :class:`TopologyObject` instances

    :Returns:
        *topologydict*
            A specialised dictionary of the topology instances passed to it

    TopologyDicts are also built lazily from a :class:`TopologyGroup.topDict`
    attribute.

    The :class:`TopologyDict` collects all the selected topology type from the
    atoms and categorises them according to the types of the atoms within.
    A :class:`TopologyGroup` containing all of a given bond type can
    be made by querying with the appropriate key.  The keys to the
    :class:`TopologyDict` are a tuple of the atom types that the bond represents
    and can be viewed using the :meth:`keys` method.

    For example, from a system containing pure ethanol ::

      >>> td = u.bonds.topDict
      >>> td.keys()
      [('C', 'C'),
       ('C', 'H'),
       ('O', 'H'),
       ('C', 'O')]
      >>> td['C', 'O']
      < TopologyGroup containing 912 bonds >

    .. Note::

       The key for a bond is taken from the type attribute of the atoms.

       Getting and setting types of bonds is done smartly, so a C-C-H
       angle is considered identical to a H-C-C angle.

    Duplicate entries are automatically removed upon creation and
    combination of different Dicts.  This means a bond between atoms
    1 and 2 will only ever appear once in a dict despite both atoms 1
    and 2 having the bond in their :attr:`bond` attribute.

    Two :class:`TopologyDict` instances can be combined using
    addition and it will not create any duplicate bonds in the process.

    .. versionadded:: 0.8

       Changed initialisation to use a list of :class:`TopologyObject`
