Topology readers --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.topology`
===============================================

This submodule contains the topology readers. A topology file supplies the list
of atoms in the system, their connectivity and possibly additional information
such as B-factors, partial charges, etc. The details depend on the file format
and not every topology file provides all (or even any) additional data. This
data is made accessible through AtomGroup properties.

As a minimum, all topology parsers will provide atom ids, atom types, masses,
resids, resnums and segids as well as assigning all atoms to residues and all
residues to segments.  For systems without residues and segments, this results
in there being a single residue and segment to which all atoms belong. Often
when data is not provided by a file, it will be guessed based on other data in
the file.  In the event that this happens, a UserWarning will always be issued.

The following table lists the currently supported topology formats along with
the attributes they provide.

        it is possible to create a full

Developer Notes
---------------

.. versionadded:: 0.8
.. versionchanged:: 0.16.0
   The new array-based topology system completely replaced the old
   system that was based on a list of Atom instances.

Topology information consists of data that do not change over time,
i.e. information that is the same for all time steps of a
trajectory. This includes

* identity of atoms (name, type, number, partial charge, ...) and to
  which residue and segment they belong; atoms are identified in
  MDAnalysis by their :attr:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom.index`,
  an integer number starting at 0 and incremented in the order of
  atoms found in the topology.

* bonds (pairs of atoms)

* angles (triplets of atoms)

* dihedral angles (quadruplets of atoms) â€” proper and improper
  dihedrals should be treated separately

Topology readers are generally called "parsers" in MDAnalysis (for
historical reasons and in order to distinguish them from coordinate
"readers"). All parsers are derived from
:class:`MDAnalysis.topology.base.TopologyReaderBase` and have a
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.topology.base.TopologyReaderBase.parse` method that
returns a :class:`MDAnalysis.core.topology.Topology` instance.


atoms
~~~~~~

The **atoms** appear to the user as an array of
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom` instances. However, under the
hood this is essentially only an array of atom indices that are used
to index the various components of the topology database
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.topology.Topology`. The parser needs to
initialize the :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.topology.Topology` with the
data read from the topology file.

.. SeeAlso:: :ref:`topology-system-label`

bonds
~~~~~~

**Bonds** are represented as a :class:`tuple` of :class:`tuple`. Each tuple
contains two atom numbers, which indicate the atoms between which the
bond is formed. Only one of the two permutations is stored, typically
the one with the lower atom number first.


bondorder
~~~~~~~~~~

Some **bonds** have additional information called **order**. When available
this is stored in a dictionary of format {bondtuple:order}.  This extra
information is then passed to Bond initialisation in u._init_bonds()


angles
~~~~~~~

**Angles** are represented by a :class:`list` of :class:`tuple`. Each
tuple contains three atom numbers.  The second of these numbers
represents the apex of the angle.


dihedrals
~~~~~~~~~

**Proper dihedral angles** are represented by a :class:`list` of :class:`tuple`. Each
tuple contains four atom numbers. The angle of the torsion
is defined by the angle between the planes formed by atoms 1, 2, and 3,
and 2, 3, and 4.


impropers
~~~~~~~~~

**Improper dihedral angles** are represented by a :class:`list` of :class:`tuple`. Each
tuple contains four atom numbers.  The angle of the improper torsion
is again defined by the angle between the planes formed by atoms 1, 2, and 3,
and 2, 3, and 4.  Improper dihedrals differ from regular dihedrals as the
four atoms need not be sequentially bonded, and are instead often all bonded
to the second atom.
