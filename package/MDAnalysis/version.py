Version information for MDAnalysis - :mod:`MDAnalysis.version`
==============================================================

The version information in :mod:`MDAnalysis.version` indicates the
release of MDAnalysis. MDAnalysis uses `semantic versioning`_ as
described in the wiki page on `versioning of MDAnalysis`_.

In brief:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we increment the

1. **MAJOR** version when we make **incompatible API changes**,
2. **MINOR** version when we **add functionality** in a
   **backwards-compatible** manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when we make backwards-compatible **bug fixes**.

However, as long as the **MAJOR** number is **0** (i.e. the API has
not stabilized), even **MINOR** increases *may* introduce incompatible
API changes. As soon as we have a 1.0.0 release, the public API can
only be changed in a backward-incompatible manner with an increase in
MAJOR version.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.


.. Note:: Development versions and pre-releases have a suffix after
          the release number, such as ``0.11.0-dev``. If you have
          problems, try out a full release (e.g. ``0.11.0``) first.
