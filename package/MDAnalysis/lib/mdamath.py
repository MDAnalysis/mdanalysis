    Parameters
    ----------
    atomgroup : AtomGroup
        The :class:`MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` to work with.
        The positions of this are modified in place.  All these atoms
        must belong in the same molecule or fragment.
    reference_atom : :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom`
        The atom around which all other atoms will be moved.
        Defaults to atom 0 in the atomgroup.

    Raises
    ------
    NoDataError
        There are no bonds present.
        (See :func:`~MDAnalysis.topology.core.guess_bonds`)

    ValueError
        The algorithm fails to work.  This is usually
        caused by the atomgroup not being a single fragment.
        (ie the molecule can't be traversed by following bonds)

    Note
    ----
    Only orthogonal boxes are currently supported.

    Example
    -------
    Make fragments whole::

        # This algorithm requires bonds, these can be guessed!
        u = mda.Universe(......, guess_bonds=True)
