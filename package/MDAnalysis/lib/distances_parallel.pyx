Fast parallel distance array computation --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.parallel.distances`
======================================================================================

:Author:  Jan Doma≈Ñski
:Year:    2012
:Licence: GPL

A fast, parallel :func:`distance_array` function as a substitute for
:func:`MDAnalysis.lib.distances.distance_array`; implemented with
`Cython Parallelism`_. For development notes see the comments for
`Issue 80`_.

.. _Cython Parallelism: http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/parallelism.html
.. _Issue 80: http://issues.mdanalysis.org/80

Load the module with ::

  import MDAnalysis.lib.parallel.distances


.. function:: distance_array(ref, conf[, box[, result]])

   Calculate all distances d_ij between the coordinates ``ref[i]`` and
   ``conf[j]`` in the numpy arrays *ref* and *conf*.

   This is a parallelized version that will automatically decide on
   how many threads to run.

   Periodic boundary conditions can be taken into account if the box
   vectors are provided in the 3x3 matrix *box*. The default ``None``
   calculates simple distances.

   A pre-allocated array can be supplied as *results*.

   .. warning::
      Only orthorhombic boxes are supported for *box*, anything else will
      produce wrong results.

   .. versionadded:: 0.7.7

.. function:: distance_array_serial(ref, conf[, box[, result]])

   Calculate all distances d_ij between the coordinates ref[i] and
   conf[j] in the numpy arrays *ref* and *conf*.

   Periodic boundary conditions can be taken into account if the box
   vectors are provided in the 3x3 matrix *box*. The default ``None``
   calculates simple distances.

   A pre-allocated array can be supplied as *results*.

   Serial version (to check the parallel version). This version is
   slightly slower than the regular serial (pure C)
   :func:`MDAnalysis.lib.distances.distance_array` function.

   .. warning::
      Only orthorhombic boxes are supported for *box*, anything else will
      produce wrong results.
