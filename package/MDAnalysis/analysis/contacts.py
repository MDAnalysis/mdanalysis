Native contacts analysis --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts`
================================================================

:Author: Oliver Beckstein

Analysis of native contacts *q* over a trajectory.

* a "contact" exists between two atoms *i* and *j* if the distance between them is
  smaller than a given *radius*

* a "native contact" exists between *i* and *j* if a contact exists and if the
  contact also exists between the equivalent atoms in a reference structure or
  conformation

The "fraction of native contacts" *q(t)* is a number between 0 and 1 and
calculated as the total number of native contacts for a given time frame
divided by the total number of contacts in the reference structure.

Classes are available for two somewhat different ways to perform a contact
analysis:

1. Contacts between two groups of atoms are defined with
   :class:`ContactAnalysis1`), which allows one to calculate *q(t)* over
   time. This is especially useful in order to look at native contacts during
   an equilibrium simulation where one can also look at the average matrix of
   native contacts (see :meth:`ContactAnalysis1.plot_qavg`).

2. Contacts are defined within one group in a protein (e.g. all C-alpha atoms)
   but relative to *two different conformations* 1 and 2, using
   :class:`ContactAnalysis`. This allows one to do a *q1-q2* analysis that
   shows how native contacts of state 1 change in comparison to native contacts
   of state 2.  Transition pathways have been analyzed in terms of these two
   variables q1 and q2 that relate to the native contacts in the end states of
   the transition.

.. SeeAlso:: See http://lorentz.dynstr.pasteur.fr/joel/adenylate.php for an
   example of contact analysis applied to MinActionPath trajectories of AdK
   (although this was *not* performed with MDAnalysis --- it's provided as a
   very good illustrative example).


Examples
--------

One-dimensional contact analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example we analyze the opening ("unzipping") of salt bridges
when the AdK enzyme opens up; this is one of the example trajectories
in MDAnalysis. ::

    import MDAnalysis
    import MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts
    from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF,DCD

    # example trajectory (transition of AdK from closed to open)
    u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PSF,DCD)

    # crude definition of salt bridges as contacts between NH/NZ in ARG/LYS and OE*/OD* in ASP/GLU.
    # You might want to think a little bit harder about the problem before using this for real work.
    sel_basic = "(resname ARG or resname LYS) and (name NH* or name NZ)"
    sel_acidic = "(resname ASP or resname GLU) and (name OE* or name OD*)"

    # reference groups (first frame of the trajectory, but you could also use a separate PDB, eg crystal structure)
    acidic = u.select_atoms(sel_acidic)
    basic = u.select_atoms(sel_basic)

    # set up analysis of native contacts ("salt bridges"); salt bridges have a distance <6 A
    CA1 = MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts.ContactAnalysis1(u, selection=(sel_acidic, sel_basic), refgroup=(acidic,
    basic), radius=6.0, outfile="qsalt.dat")

    # iterate through trajectory and perform analysis of "native contacts" q
    # (force=True ignores any previous results, force=True is useful when testing)
    CA1.run(force=True)

    # plot time series q(t) [possibly do "import pylab; pylab.clf()" do clear the figure first...]
    CA1.plot(filename="adk_saltbridge_contact_analysis1.pdf", linewidth=3, color="blue")

    # or plot the data in qsalt.dat yourself.
    CA1.plot_qavg(filename="adk_saltbridge_contact_analysis1_matrix.pdf")

The first graph shows that when AdK opens, about 20% of the salt
bridges that existed in the closed state disappear when the enzyme
opens. They open in a step-wise fashion (made more clear by the movie
http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/Movies/AdK/AdK_zipper_cartoon.avi
(divx, on Mac use http://perian.org)).

The output graphs can be made prettier but if you look at the code
itself then you'll quickly figure out what to do. The qavg plot is the
matrix of all contacts, averaged over the trajectory. This plot makes
more sense for an equilibrium trajectory than for the example above
but is is included for illustration.

See the docs for :class:`ContactAnalysis1` for another example.


Two-dimensional contact analysis (q1-q2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analyze a single DIMS transition of AdK between its closed and open
conformation and plot the trajectory projected on q1-q2::

  import MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts
  from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import *
  C = MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts.ContactAnalysis(PSF, DCD)
  C.run()
  C.plot()

Compare the resulting pathway to the `MinActionPath result for AdK`_.

    This analysis class allows one to calculate the fraction of native contacts
    *q* between two arbitrary groups of atoms with respect to an arbitrary
    reference structure. For instance, as a reference one could take a crystal
    structure of a complex, and as the two groups atoms one selects two
    molecules A and B in the complex. Then the question to be answered by *q*
    is, is which percentage of the contacts between A and B persist during the simulation.

    First prepare :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup` selections for
    the reference atoms; this example uses some arbitrary selections::

      ref = Universe('crystal.pdb')
      refA = re.select_atoms('name CA and segid A and resid 6:100')
      refB = re.select_atoms('name CA and segid B and resid 1:40')

    Load the trajectory::

      u = Universe(topology, trajectory)

    We then need two selection strings *selA* and *selB* that, when applied as
    ``u.select_atoms(selA)`` produce a list of atoms that is equivalent to the
    reference (i.e. ``u.select_atoms(selA)`` must select the same atoms as
    ``refA`` in this example)::

      selA = 'name CA and resid 1:95'     # corresponds to refA
      selB = 'name CA and resid 150:189'  # corresponds to refB

    .. Note::

       It is the user's responsibility to provide a reference group
       (or groups) that describe equivalent atoms to the ones selected
       by *selection*.

    Now we are ready to set up the analysis::

      CA1 = ContactAnalysis1(u, selection=(selA,selB), refgroup=(refA,refB), radius=8.0, outfile="q.dat")

    If the groups do not match in length then a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

    The analysis across the whole trajectory is performed with ::

      CA1.run()

    Results are saved to *outfile* (``framenumber q N`` per line) and
    can also be plotted with ::

      CA1.plot()        # plots the time series q(t)
