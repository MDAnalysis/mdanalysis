"""Coordinate fitting and alignment --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.analysis.align`
=====================================================================

:Author: Oliver Beckstein, Joshua Adelman
:Year: 2010--2013
:Copyright: GNU Public License v3

The module contains functions to fit a target structure to a reference
structure. They use the fast QCP algorithm to calculate the root mean
square distance (RMSD) between two coordinate sets [Theobald2005]_ and
the rotation matrix *R* that minimizes the RMSD [Liu2010]_. (Please
cite these references when using this module.).

Typically, one selects a group of atoms (such as the C-alphas),
calculates the RMSD and transformation matrix, and applys the
transformation to the current frame of a trajectory to obtain the
rotated structure. The :func:`alignto` and :class:`AlignTraj`
functions can be used to do this for individual frames and
trajectories respectively.

The :ref:`RMS-fitting-tutorial` shows how to do the individual steps
manually and explains the intermediate steps.

See Also
--------
:mod:`MDAnalysis.analysis.rms`
     contains functions to compute RMSD (when structural alignment is not
     required)
:mod:`MDAnalysis.lib.qcprot`
     implements the fast RMSD algorithm.


.. _RMS-fitting-tutorial:

RMS-fitting tutorial
--------------------

The example uses files provided as part of the MDAnalysis test suite
(in the variables :data:`~MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles.PSF`,
:data:`~MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles.DCD`, and
:data:`~MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles.PDB_small`). For all further
examples execute first ::

   >>> import MDAnalysis as mda
   >>> from MDAnalysis.analysis import align
   >>> from MDAnalysis.analysis.rms import rmsd
   >>> from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF, DCD, PDB_small


In the simplest case, we can simply calculate the C-alpha RMSD between
two structures, using :func:`rmsd`::

   >>> ref = mda.Universe(PDB_small)
   >>> mobile = mda.Universe(PSF,DCD)
   >>> rmsd(mobile.select_atoms('name CA').positions, ref.select_atoms('name CA').positions)
   16.282308620224068

Note that in this example translations have not been removed. In order
to look at the pure rotation one needs to superimpose the centres of
mass (or geometry) first:

   >>> rmsd(mobile.select_atoms('name CA').positions, ref.select_atoms('name CA').positions, center=True)
   12.639693690256898

This has only done a translational superposition. If you want to also do a
rotational superposition use the superposition keyword. This will calculate a
minimized RMSD between the reference and mobile structure.

   >>> rmsd(mobile.select_atoms('name CA').positions, ref.select_atoms('name CA').positions,
   >>>      superposition=True)
   6.8093965864717951

The rotation matrix that superimposes *mobile* on *ref* while
minimizing the CA-RMSD is obtained with the :func:`rotation_matrix`
function ::

   >>> mobile0 = mobile.select_atoms('name CA').positions - mobile.atoms.center_of_mass()
   >>> ref0 = ref.select_atoms('name CA').positions - ref.atoms.center_of_mass()
   >>> R, rmsd = align.rotation_matrix(mobile0, ref0)
   >>> print rmsd
   6.8093965864717951
   >>> print R
   [[ 0.14514539 -0.27259113  0.95111876]
    [ 0.88652593  0.46267112 -0.00268642]
    [-0.43932289  0.84358136  0.30881368]]

Putting all this together one can superimpose all of *mobile* onto *ref*::

   >>> mobile.atoms.translate(-mobile.select_atoms('name CA').center_of_mass())
   >>> mobile.atoms.rotate(R)
   >>> mobile.atoms.translate(ref.select_atoms('name CA').center_of_mass())
   >>> mobile.atoms.write("mobile_on_ref.pdb")


Common usage
------------

To **fit a single structure** with :func:`alignto`::

   >>> ref = mda.Universe(PSF, PDB_small)
   >>> mobile = mda.Universe(PSF, DCD)     # we use the first frame
   >>> align.alignto(mobile, ref, select="protein and name CA", weights="mass")

This will change *all* coordinates in *mobile* so that the protein
C-alpha atoms are optimally superimposed (translation and rotation).

To **fit a whole trajectory** to a reference structure with the
:class:`AlignTraj` class::

   >>> ref = mda.Universe(PSF, PDB_small)   # reference structure 1AKE
   >>> trj = mda.Universe(PSF, DCD)         # trajectory of change 1AKE->4AKE
   >>> alignment = align.AlignTraj(trj, ref, filename='rmsfit.dcd')
   >>> alignment.run()

It is also possible to align two arbitrary structures by providing a
mapping between atoms based on a sequence alignment. This allows
fitting of structural homologs or wild type and mutant.

If a alignment was provided as "sequences.aln" one would first produce
the appropriate MDAnalysis selections with the :func:`fasta2select`
function and then feed the resulting dictionary to :class:`AlignTraj`::

   >>> seldict = align.fasta2select('sequences.aln')
   >>> alignment = align.AlignTraj(trj, ref, filename='rmsfit.dcd', select=seldict)
   >>> alignment.run()

(See the documentation of the functions for this advanced usage.)

    """Perform a spatial superposition by minimizing the RMSD.

    Spatially align the group of atoms `mobile` to `reference` by
    doing a RMSD fit on `select` atoms.

    The superposition is done in the following way:

    1. A rotation matrix is computed that minimizes the RMSD between
       the coordinates of `mobile.select_atoms(sel1)` and
       `reference.select_atoms(sel2)`; before the rotation, `mobile` is
       translated so that its center of geometry (or center of mass)
       coincides with the one of `reference`. (See below for explanation of
       how *sel1* and *sel2* are derived from `select`.)

    2. All atoms in :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe` that
       contain `mobile` are shifted and rotated. (See below for how
       to change this behavior through the `subselection` keyword.)

    The `mobile` and `reference` atom groups can be constructed so that they
    already match atom by atom. In this case, `select` should be set to "all"
    (or ``None``) so that no further selections are applied to `mobile` and
    `reference`, therefore preserving the exact atom ordering (see
    :ref:`ordered-selections-label`).

    .. Warning:: The atom order for `mobile` and `reference` is *only*
       preserved when `select` is either "all" or ``None``. In any other case,
       a new selection will be made that will sort the resulting AtomGroup by
       index and therefore destroy the correspondence between the two groups.
       **It is safest not to mix ordered AtomGroups with selection strings.**

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobile : Universe or AtomGroup
       structure to be aligned, a
       :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` or a whole
       :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`
    reference : Universe or AtomGroup
       reference structure, a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
       or a whole :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`
    select : str or dict or tuple (optional)
       The selection to operate on; can be one of:

       1. any valid selection string for
          :meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup.select_atoms` that
          produces identical selections in `mobile` and `reference`; or

       2. a dictionary ``{'mobile': sel1, 'reference': sel2}`` where *sel1*
          and *sel2* are valid selection strings that are applied to
          `mobile` and `reference` respectively (the
          :func:`MDAnalysis.analysis.align.fasta2select` function returns such
          a dictionary based on a ClustalW_ or STAMP_ sequence alignment); or

       3. a tuple ``(sel1, sel2)``

       When using 2. or 3. with *sel1* and *sel2* then these selection strings
       are applied to `atomgroup` and `reference` respectively and should
       generate *groups of equivalent atoms*.  *sel1* and *sel2* can each also
       be a *list of selection strings* to generate a
       :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` with defined atom order as
       described under :ref:`ordered-selections-label`).
    match_atoms : bool (optional)
        Whether to match the mobile and reference atom-by-atom. Default ``True``.
    weights : {"mass", ``None``} or array_like (optional)
       choose weights. With ``"mass"`` uses masses as weights; with ``None``
       weigh each atom equally. If a float array of the same length as
       `mobile` is provided, use each element of the `array_like` as a
       weight for the corresponding atom in `mobile`.
    tol_mass: float (optional)
       Reject match if the atomic masses for matched atoms differ by more than
       `tol_mass`, default [0.1]
    strict: bool (optional)
       ``True``
           Will raise :exc:`SelectionError` if a single atom does not
           match between the two selections.
       ``False`` [default]
           Will try to prepare a matching selection by dropping
           residues with non-matching atoms. See :func:`get_matching_atoms`
           for details.
    subselection : str or AtomGroup or None (optional)
       Apply the transformation only to this selection.

       ``None`` [default]
           Apply to ``mobile.universe.atoms`` (i.e., all atoms in the
           context of the selection from `mobile` such as the rest of a
           protein, ligands and the surrounding water)
       *selection-string*
           Apply to ``mobile.select_atoms(selection-string)``
       :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
           Apply to the arbitrary group of atoms

    The function aligns two sequences provided in a FASTA file and
    constructs MDAnalysis selection strings of the common atoms. When
    these two strings are applied to the two different proteins they
    will generate AtomGroups of the aligned residues.

    `fastafilename` contains the two un-aligned sequences in FASTA
    format. The reference is assumed to be the first sequence, the
    target the second. ClustalW_ produces a pairwise
    alignment (which is written to a file with suffix ``.aln``).  The
    output contains atom selection strings that select the same atoms
    in the two structures.

    Unless `ref_offset` and/or `target_offset` are specified, the resids
    in the structure are assumed to correspond to the positions in the
    un-aligned sequence, namely the first residue has resid == 1.

    In more complicated cases (e.g., when the resid numbering in the
    input structure has gaps due to missing parts), simply provide the
    sequence of resids as they appear in the topology in `ref_resids` or
    `target_resids`, e.g. ::

def get_matching_atoms(ag1, ag2, tol_mass=0.1, strict=False, match_atoms=True):
    """Return two atom groups with one-to-one matched atoms.

    The function takes two :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
    instances `ag1` and `ag2` and returns two atom groups `g1` and `g2` that
    consist of atoms so that the mass of atom ``g1[0]`` is the same as the mass
    of atom ``g2[0]``, ``g1[1]`` and ``g2[1]`` etc.

    The current implementation is very simplistic and works on a per-residue basis:

    1. The two groups must contain the same number of residues.
    2. Any residues in each group that have differing number of atoms are discarded.
    3. The masses of corresponding atoms are compared. and if any masses differ
       by more than `tol_mass` the test is considered failed and a
       :exc:`SelectionError` is raised.

    The log file (see :func:`MDAnalysis.start_logging`) will contain detailed
    information about mismatches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ag1 : AtomGroup
        First :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` instance that is
        compared
    ag2 : AtomGroup
        Second :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup` instance that is
        compared
    tol_mass : float (optional)
         Reject if the atomic masses for matched atoms differ by more than
         `tol_mass` [0.1]
    strict : bool (optional)
        ``True``
            Will raise :exc:`SelectionError` if a single atom does not
            match between the two selections.
        ``False`` [default]
            Will try to prepare a matching selection by dropping
            residues with non-matching atoms. See :func:`get_matching_atoms`
            for details.
    match_atoms : bool (optional)
        ``True``
            Will attempt to match atoms based on mass
        ``False``
            Will not attempt to match atoms based on mass

    Returns
    -------
    (g1, g2) : tuple
        Tuple with :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup`
        instances that match, atom by atom. The groups are either the
        original groups if all matched or slices of the original
        groups.

    Raises
    ------
    :exc:`SelectionError`
        Error raised if the number of residues does not match or if in the final
        matching masses differ by more than *tol*.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm could be improved by using e.g. the Needleman-Wunsch
    algorithm in :mod:`Bio.profile2` to align atoms in each residue (doing a
    global alignment is too expensive).
