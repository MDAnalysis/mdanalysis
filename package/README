  MDAnalysis README
=====================

MDAnalysis_ is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

.. _MDAnalysis: http://www.mdanalysis.org

It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the
atomic coordinates through numpy arrays. This provides a flexible and
relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In addition,
CHARMM-style atom selection commands are implemented. Trajectories can
also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and
written out.

Code is hosted at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis

The Online Documentation is available at http://pythonhosted.org//MDAnalysis/

The html manual is also located in the docs/ directory of the source
distribution.

For installation instruction please have a look at INSTALL and the
