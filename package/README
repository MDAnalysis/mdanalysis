  MDAnalysis README
=====================

MDAnalysis_ is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

.. _MDAnalysis: https://www.mdanalysis.org

It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the
atomic coordinates through numpy arrays. This provides a flexible and
relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In addition,
CHARMM-style atom selection commands are implemented. Trajectories can
also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and
written out.

Code is hosted at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis
