# MDAnalysis example: native contact analysis (q1-q2)

"""
Example: Calculating the percentage of native contacts
======================================================

The percentag of native contacts, q, is the number of observed contacts
relative to the number of contacts in a reference state (typically, the
native state). The number of  *contacts* is the total number of unique CA atoms
within in a fixed radius of all CA atoms.

This example script takes a trajectory of AdK in which the enzyme transitions
from the closed to the open state. Two sets of native contacts are computed:

*q1*
   contacts relative to the initial (closed) state, pdb 1AKE
*q2*
   contacts relative to the final (open) state, pdb 4AKE

The trajectory was generated with the dynamic importance sampling method (DIMS)
and taken from [Beckstein2009].

The final result is stored in a bzipped data file `adk_dims_q1q2.dat.bz2` and
the q1-q2 graph is also written to `figures/nativecontacts.pdf`
(requires :mod:`matplotlib`).
