  MDAnalysis
==============

MDAnalysis is a python framework to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by Charmm, NAMD, or LAMMPS (Gromacs support is
in the working...).

It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the
atomic coordinates through numpy arrays. This provides an extremely
flexible and relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In
addition, Charmm-style atom selection commands are
implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance, fit
to a reference structure) and written out.

Code and documentation is hosted at http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/


For installation instruction please have a look at INSTALL.
