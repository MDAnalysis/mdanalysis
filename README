  MDAnalysisTestData README
=============================

MDAnalysis is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

.. NOTE:: *This* package only contains data files that are used in the
          test suite of the MDAnalysis package
          http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis. They should be
          installed together with MDAnalysis.

	  You can get MDAnalysis from
	  http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis.

The test files change less frequently, take up almost 20 GB of space,
and are not needed for daily use of MDAnalysis so they are distributed
separately from the main package.

For installation instruction please have a look at INSTALL and the
instructions online at http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/Install
