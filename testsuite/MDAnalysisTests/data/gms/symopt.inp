! EXAM 12.
!   This job illustrates linear bends, for acetylene.
!   The optimal RHF/STO-2G geometry is located.
!
!   At the input geometry,
!   the FINAL E= -73.5036974734 after 7 iterations,
!   and the RMS gradient is 0.1506891.
!
!   At the final geometry, 7 steps later,
!   the FINAL E= -73.6046483165, RMS gradient=0.0000028,
!   R(CC)=1.1777007 and R(CH)=1.0749435.
