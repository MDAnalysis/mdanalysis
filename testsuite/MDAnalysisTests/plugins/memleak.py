"""Test plugin that reports memleaks (objects deemed uncollectable by python's garbage collector) on a test-by-test basis.

The plugin works by clearing a test's namespace after it has run, and then
forcing a garbage collection round and checking for uncollectable objects.

Implementation uses the startTest and stopTest hooks. To prevent premature
success declaration (since the memleak check only runs after the test) the test's
:class:`nose.proxy.ResultProxy` is monkey-patched with a silent :meth:`addSuccess` method. This
might seem hackish, but it is how other `:class:nose.plugins.errorclass.ErrorClassPlugins`
are implemented.
