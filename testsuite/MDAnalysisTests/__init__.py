=========================
Test cases for MDAnalysis
=========================

The test cases and the test data are kept in this package,
MDAnalysisTests. They will only run when MDAnalysis is also
installed. MDAnalysis and MDAnalysisTests *must* have the same release
number, which can be found :data:`MDAnalysis.__version__` and
:data:`MDAnalysisTests.__version__`. If the versions don't match then
an :exc:`ImportError` is raised.

We are using the NumPy_ testing frame work; thus, numpy *must* be
installed for the tests to run at all.

Run all the tests with

   >>> import MDAnalysisTests.tests
   >>> MDAnalysisTests.tests.test(label='full')

Some tests can take a few seconds; in order to skip the slow tests run

   >>> MDAnalysisTests.tests.test(label='fast')

Additional information is displayed at a higher verbosity level (the default is
1):

   >>> MDAnalysisTests.tests.test(label='fast', verbose=3)

Note that if no tests are being run then one might have to run the
tests with the ``--exe`` flag

   >>> MDAnalysisTests.tests.test(label='fast', extra_argv=['--exe'])

(This happens when python files are installed with the executable bit set. By
default the nose_ testing framework refuses to use those files and must be
encouraged to do so with the ``--exe`` switch.)

See `nose commandline options`_ for additional options that can be used; for
instance, code coverage can also be checked:

  >>> MDAnalysisTests.tests.test(label='full', extra_argv=['--exe', '--with-coverage'])


Data
====

The simulation data used in some tests are from [Beckstein2009]_ (``adk.psf``,
``adk_dims.dcd``) or unpublished simulations (O. Beckstein).

   adk_dims
      Trajectory of a macromolecular transition of the enzyme adenylate kinase
      between a closed and an open conformation. The simulation was run in
      Charmm_ c35a1.

   adk_oplsaa
      Ten frames from the first 1 ns of a equilibrium trajectory of AdK in
      water with Na+ counter ions. The OPLS/AA forcefield is used with the
      TIP4P water model. The simulation was run with Gromacs_ 4.0.2.

Writing test cases
==================

The unittests use the :mod:`unittest` module together with nose_. See the
examples in the ``MDAnalysisTests`` directory.

The `SciPy testing guidelines`_ are a good howto for writing test cases,
especially as we are directly using this framework (imported from numpy).
