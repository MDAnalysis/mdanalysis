"""=========================
Test cases for MDAnalysis
=========================

The test cases and the test data are kept in this package,
MDAnalysisTests. They will only run when MDAnalysis is also
installed. MDAnalysis and MDAnalysisTests *must* have the same release
number, which can be found in :data:`MDAnalysis.__version__` and
:data:`MDAnalysisTests.__version__`. If the versions don't match then
an :exc:`ImportError` is raised.

We are using the NumPy_ testing frame work; thus, :mod:`numpy` *must* be
installed for the tests to run at all.

Run all the tests with ::

    pytest --pyargs MDAnalysisTests

If you have the `pytest-xdist`_ plugin installed then you can run the
tests in parallel

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -n 4 --pyargs MDAnalysisTests


.. _`pytest-xdist`:
   https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist


Data
====

The simulation data used in some tests are from [Beckstein2009]_ (``adk.psf``,
``adk_dims.dcd``) or unpublished simulations (O. Beckstein).

   adk_dims
      Trajectory of a macromolecular transition of the enzyme adenylate kinase
      between a closed and an open conformation. The simulation was run in
      Charmm_ c35a1.

   adk_oplsaa
      Ten frames from the first 1 ns of a equilibrium trajectory of AdK in
      water with Na+ counter ions. The OPLS/AA forcefield is used with the
      TIP4P water model. The simulation was run with Gromacs_ 4.0.2.

Writing test cases
==================

The unittests use the :mod:`pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ module. See the
examples in the ``MDAnalysisTests`` directory.

The `SciPy testing guidelines`_ are a good howto for writing test cases,
especially as we are directly using this framework (imported from numpy).
