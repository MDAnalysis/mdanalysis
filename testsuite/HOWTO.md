The unit tests and the test data are bundled together in the package **MDAnalyisTests**. In order to run the tests, this package must be installed in addition to MDAnalysis.

The tests also rely on the `pytest` and `numpy` packages, and require both to run.

# Users
Install [MDAnalysisTests](MDAnalysisTests) via **pip**
```
pip install --upgrade MDAnalysisTests
```

or via **conda**
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install MDAnalysisTests
```
or download the tar file, unpack, and run `python setup.py install`.

Run the tests by invoking
```
python -c 'from MDAnalysisTests import run; run()'
```

All tests should pass (i.e. no **FAIL**, **ERROR**); *SKIPPED* or *XFAIL* are ok. For anything that fails or gives an error [ask on the user mailing list](http://users.mdanalysis.org) or [raise an issue](/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues).

# Developers #

We are borrowing some of NumPy's testing frame work; thus, numpy **must** be installed for the tests to run at all.


It is recommended that you run the tests from the [git source repository](Source), which are located in the [testsuite/MDAnalysisTests](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/tree/develop/testsuite) directory:
```
cd testsuite/MDAnalysisTests
pytest  --disable-pytest-warnings
```
Note: We use the `--disable-pytest-warnings` flag to currently suppress warnings about `yeild` based tests. Work in being done to fix this and you shouldn't need the flag if you are running a singe file/test.

Running the tests serially can take some time, depending on the performance of your computer. (You can speed this up by running tests in parallel using pytest-xdist - explained in the plugin section)

To run specific tests just specify the path to the test file:
```
pytest path_to/MDAnalysisTests/analysis/test_align.py
```
Note: You have to replace `path_to` with the actual path to where the code is.

Specific test classes inside test files, and even specific test methods, can also be specified:
```
# Test the entire TestContactMatrix class
pytest path_to/MDAnalysisTests/analysis/test_analysis.py::TestContactMatrix


# Test only test_sparse in the TestContactMatrix class
pytest path_to/MDAnalysisTests/analysis/test_analysis.py::TestContactMatrix::test_sparse
```
This is very useful when you add a new test and want to check if it passes.

### Plugins

* **pytest-xdist** - This can be used to run the tests in parallel.
    ```
    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest --disable-pytest-warnings --numprocesses 4
    ```
    You can try increasing the number of processes to speed up the test run depending on you machine.

* **pytest-cov** This can be used to generate the coverage report locally.
    ```
    pip install pytest-cov
    pytest --cov=MDAnalysis --cov-report html
    ```
    Note: You can use the `--numprocesses` flag with the above command too.

    This will create a `htmlcov` folder (in the directory you run the command from) and there will be an `index.html` file in this folder, Open this file in your browser and you will be able to see the coverage.


## Data ##
The simulation data used in tests are all released under the same license as MDAnalysis or are in the Public Domain (such as PDBs from the Protein Databank). An incomplete list of sources:
* from Beckstein et al. (2009) (`adk.psf`,`adk_dims.dcd`)
  * _adk\_dims_      Trajectory of a macromolecular transition of the enzyme adenylate kinase between a closed and an open conformation. The simulation was run in [CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org) c35a1.
* unpublished simulations (O. Beckstein)
  * _adk\_oplsaa_    Ten frames from the first 1 ns of a equilibrium trajectory of AdK in water with Na+ counter ions. The OPLS/AA forcefield is used with the TIP4P water model. The simulation was run with [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org) 4.0.2.

# Writing test cases #

The tests are in a separate package, together with any data files required for running the tests (see [Issue 87](http://issues.mdanalysis.org/87) for details). Whenever you _add a new feature_ to the code you _should also add a test case_ (ideally, in the same git commit so that the code and the test case are treated as one unit).

The unit tests use the [unittest module](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html) together with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). See the examples in the [MDAnalysisTests](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/tree/develop/testsuite/MDAnalysisTests) package.

The [SciPy testing guidelines](http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/TestingGuidelines#id11) are a good howto for writing test cases.

Conventions for MDAnalysis
  * Relative import statements are now banned from unit testing modules (see [Issue #189](/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/189) for details)
  * using `os.chdir()` is banned because it can break the tests in really weird ways (see [Issue #556](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/556)): use `with tempdir.in_tempdir()` or something similar
  * Test input data is stored in  [MDAnalysisTests/data](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/tree/develop/testsuite/MDAnalysisTests/data).
    * Keep files small if possible; for trajectories 10 frames or less are sufficient.
    * Add the file name of test data files to [MDAnalysisTests/datafiles.py](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/develop/testsuite/MDAnalysisTests/datafiles.py) (see the code for details).
    * Add the file(s) or a glob pattern to the `package_data` in [setup.py](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/develop/testsuite/setup.py); otherwise the file will not be included in the python package.
    * If you use data from a published paper then add a reference to _this wiki page_ and the doc string in [MDAnalysisTests/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/develop/testsuite/MDAnalysisTests/__init__.py).
  * Tests are currently organized by top-level module. Each file containing tests must start with `test_` by convention (unittest works). Tests itself also have to follow the appropriate naming conventions. See the docs above or the source.
  * Add a test for
    * new functionality
    * fixed issues (typically named `test_IssueXX` or referencing the issue in the doc string (to avoid regression)
    * anything you think worthwhile â€“ the more the better!


# Changes with releases #

The way we organized the unit tests changed between releases. The procedure for the current release is detailed at the very top of the page. The following list is for historical reference and in case you ever want to go back to a previous release.
  1. release **0.16.2**: the testsuite was overhauled to remove dependency from nose and move to pytest. See issue [#884](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/884) for more details. `pytest` is the way to run the tests and `mda_nosetests` has been removed.
  1. since **0.11.0**: the testing subsystem was overhauled to allow the use of plugins external to nose. We also no longer use numpy's `test()` wrapper. `mda_nosetests` is now the preferred way to run the tests from the command-line in a mostly backward-compatible way with the usage of `nosetests`. Most numpy-specific arguments to `test()` are now deprecated in favor of nose flags.
  1. since **0.7.5**: tests _and_ data are together in package **MDAnalysisTests**. See [Issue 87](http://issues.mdanalysis.org/87) for details.
  1. release **0.7.4**: tests are in **MDAnalysis** and data is in **MDAnalysisTestData** (for MDAnalysis == 0.7.4). To install [MDAnalysisTestData](MDAnalysisTestData) download the `MDAnalysisTestData-0.7.4.tar.gz` from the [Download](http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/downloads/list) section or try ```easy_install http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/files/MDAnalysisTestData-0.7.4.tar.gz```
  1. release **0.6.1** to **0.7.3**: tests and data were included with **MDAnalysis**
  1. release **0.4** to **0.6.0**: no tests included
