MDAnalysis_ is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

.. NOTE:: *This* package only contains the UnitTests and the data
          files that are used in the test suite of the MDAnalysis_
          package https://www.mdanalysis.org. They should be
          installed together with MDAnalysis_.

The test files change less frequently, take up around 70 MB of space,
and are not needed for daily use of MDAnalysis so they are distributed
separately from the main package.

For installation instruction please have a look at INSTALL and the
instructions online at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/INSTALL

The tests are described at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/UnitTests

For further information please see the `documentation for MDAnalysis`_
itself.
