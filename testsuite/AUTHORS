External code
-------------

External code (under a GPL-compatible licence) was obtained from
various sources. The authors (as far as we know them) are listed here.

xdrfile
  - David van der Spoel <david.vanderspoel@icm.uu.se>
  - Erik Lindahl <erik.lindahl@scilifelab.se>
  - Frans van Hoesel <f.h.j.van.hoesel@rug.nl> (not listed as an xdrfile
    author, but the original author of the XTC coordinate compression code)

  The Gromacs libxdrfile (LGPL-licensed) was used before MDAnalysis
   version 0.8.0.
  Between MDAnalysis versions 0.8.0 and 0.13.0 libxdrfile was replaced by
   libxdrfile2, our GPLv2 enhanced derivative of libxdrfile.
  Since version 0.14.0 xdr enhanecments were rebased onto Gromacs'
   xdrfile 1.1.4 code (now BSD-licensed). Our contributions remain GPLv2
   and were split into files xtc_seek.c, trr_seek.c, xtc_seek.h, and
   trr_seek.h, for clarity (xdrfile 1.1.4 code is distributed with minor
   modifications). Also for clarity we now name the resulting enhanced
   xdr-reading library, complete with cython bindings, 'libmdaxdr'.
