# Governance of MDAnalysis

Please see [About MDAnalysis: Governance](https://www.mdanalysis.org/about/#governance) for the description of how decisions are made for the MDAnalysis project.

Below is a summary of the governance model (but note that if the text on this page and the page  [About MDAnalysis: Governance](https://www.mdanalysis.org/about/#governance)  disagree then the [About MDAnalysis: Governance](https://www.mdanalysis.org/about/#governance) page takes precedence):

----

Project leadership is provided by a subset of contributors, the **MDAnalysis Core Developers** ([@MDAnalysis/coredevs](https://github.com/orgs/MDAnalysis/teams/coredevs)) who have produced substantial contributions over extended lengths of time and who remain active in reviewing issues and discussions on the various mailing lists. MDAnalysis Core Developers are granted commit rights (write access) to the GitHub source code repository. New MDAnalysis Core Developers are elected with a simple majority of current MDAnalysis Core Developers.

All decisions are made by simple majority of the MDAnalysis Core Developers.

A rotating subset of three MDAnalysis Core Developers is tasked to respond to and to investigate [Code of Conduct](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/conduct/) violations.
