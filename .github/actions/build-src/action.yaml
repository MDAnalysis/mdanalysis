    # Details on build isolation can be found here:
    # https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#build-isolation
    #
    # A short description of how this works in pratice is provided here:
    # * If build isolation is on, pip will create wheels for MDAnalysis in a
    #   fully isolated temporary environment hence making sure that build
    #   requirements are handled independently of the runtime environment
    #   (whatever is already in your Python PATH at the time of install).
    #   For example, with build isolation on, you could have an old version
    #   of NumPy available in your current Python environment, but build with
    #   a much newer one.
    # * If build isolation is off (through the --no-build-isolation flag), the
    #   pip build system depends on what is currently avaiable in your Python
    #   environment. So if NumPy is necessary and you have a version already
    #   installed, it will just use that directly. There is a massive potential
    #   for breaking an environment if misused, so this is very much advised
    #   only in cases where you know exactly what your enviroment does / has
    #   (such as the tests we run here).
    #
    # In practice we use build isolation in MDAnalysis CI when:
    # * We are trying to test MDAnalysis with a different / older runtime
    #   version of a key build dependency (e.g. NumPy).
    # We don't use build isolation when:
    # * We know we have already installed the required dependencies earlier
    #   and we want to make sure that we use those dependnecies for the build
    #   (e.g. we want to check that the packages we pulled for conda-forge
    #    work for the build, not the ones from PyPi).
    # * We want to test the build & runtime with a sepecial version of a
    #   build dependency that won't get picked up by the pip install. For
    #   example, when we use nightly wheels of NumPy.
