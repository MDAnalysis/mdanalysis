The issue tracker is meant for DEFECTS ("BUGS"), new FEATURES, and decisions on the API. In order to keep the volume of work on the issue tracker manageable for our volunteer developers, we will migrate issues with questions to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/discussions).

We really appreciate you getting in touch with us --- no matter what you want to discuss. But we need your help keeping the amount of work manageable so please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/discussions) for questions and the issue tracker for code-related issues.

Thank you!

The MDAnalysis Development Team
